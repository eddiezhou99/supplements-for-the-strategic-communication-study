Thank you.

Welcome to the Steve Jobs

Theater.

Wasn't that a fun video?

Things certainly do get hectic

around here leading up to days

like this, but they're also

magical days because we get to

share our latest innovations

with you.

As you know, Apple was founded

to make the computer more

personal.

Of course, first with the Apple

2 and then later with the Mac.

Over the years, we've taken this

mission further than anyone

could have imagined.

We've created several categories

of technology that have had a

profound impact on people's

lives.

From the iPod to the iPhone to

the iPad to the Apple watch, and

we've completely reinvented the

retail experience, making it

more personal and engaging.

Our stores have become part of

the community.

They're open, beautiful,

inspiring places to learn and

gather.

Like this gorgeous store, the

Apple Piazza Liberty, it's

revitalizing a plaza in the

heart of Milan.

The store opened to thousands of

customers who came to experience

a weekend full of events, and we

know it's going to be popular

for years to come.

In fact, our Apple stores are

now welcoming over 500 hundred

million visitors per year.

Thank you.

We love that so many customers

had the chance to experience our

products first hand and get the

personal help that they need to

get the most out of them.

Of course, we aim to put the

customer at the center of

everything that we do.

That's why iOS is not just the

world's most advanced mobile

operating system, it's the most

personal.

We're about to hit a major

milestone.

We are about to ship our 2

billionth iOS device.

This is astonishing, iOS has

changed the way we live, from

the way we learn, to the way we

work.

To how we're entertained, to how

we shop, order our food, get our

transportation, and stay in

touch with one another.

And of course, how we capture

the moments of our lives and

share them with those we love.

It's amazing how our mission

started with personalizing

technology for the desktop to

now seeing the many ways that

we've made it more personal in

so many aspects of our lives.

So it's only fitting that today

we're going to tell you about

two of our most personal

products, the ones that are with

you everywhere that you go, and

how we're going to take them

even further.

So let's get started with the

Apple Watch.

Yeah.

We're thrilled by how much the

Apple Watch has grown in such a

short period of time.

I mean to think this category

didn't even exist just a few

years ago, and now Apple Watch

is being embraced by so many

people around the world.

Apple Watch is not only the

number one smart watch in the

world, it's the number one watch

period.

Apple Watch has redefined what a

watch can do for you.

It's the integration of

breakthrough technology and

powerful software and

world-class services that bring

it to life.

For millions of people around

the world, Apple Watch has

become an indispensable part of

their daily lives by helping

them stay connected, to be more

active, and to live a healthier

day.

To tell you how we're going to

take Apple Watch to the next

level, I'd like to invite Jeff.

Jeff.

Wow, thank you, thank you.

We're humbled and inspired by

how Apple Watch has become such

an important and even essential

part of people's lives, and it's

becoming more indispensable in

three areas in particular.

It keeps you connected to the

people and information you care

about with phone calls and

messages and notifications right

on your wrist, and cellular lets

you stay connected with just

your Apple Watch, even if you

leave your phone behind.

Fitness is at the core of Apple

Watch, encouraging you to be

more active by closing your

rings and tracking your

workouts, and now you have

built-in GPS.

It's swim proof, and it even

automatically detects when

you're working out.

And health.

Health has been at the core of

Apple Watch as well.

Apple Watch put heart rate

monitoring right on the wrist,

and while you could always check

your heart rate, Apple Watch now

looks in the background and

notifies you if it detects an

elevated heart rate.

This may seem like a simple

change, but we see this in our

customer letters.

It's a profound change.

Apple Watch has become an

intelligent guardian for your

health.

Today, in each of these areas,

staying connected, living an

active life, and managing your

health we're taking Apple Watch

to the next level.

And now, I'd like to introduce

the next generation of Apple

Watch.

Apple Watch Series 4.

Everything about it has been

redesigned and reengineered.

Every detail has been

thoughtfully considered and it's

just beautiful.

It all starts with a stunning

new display.

We pushed the screens right to

the edges, and we curved the

corners to perfectly match the

shape of the watch.

And the screens are

significantly larger.

In fact, they're over 30 percent

larger.

Thank you.

And we've done this with minimal

changes to the case size.

Series 4 is thinner, so there's

actually less total volume than

in Series 3.

And to take advantage of the new

display, every part of the UI

has been redesigned.

You'll see more in maps and

photo and calendar, and we've

created new complications.

They look beautiful, and they

show even more information and

detail.

And we've also designed a

brand-new watch face with up to

eight complications that really

brings them to life.

And you can customize it with

the things you care about.

Now, you can add loved ones to

your watch face and simply tap

to connect with them.

Or if you're traveling, you can

customize the watch face to

track the different time zones.

Or maybe you want to create the

ultimate health and fitness

watch.

We also redesigned the modular

face with more detailed and

graphical information from apps

like stocks and heart rate and

activity and even apps from our

developers, so now you can track

the live score of your favorite

team with MLB at Bat.

Your boarding information will

appear right on your watch face

with the Quantas app.

Or you can glance at nutritional

intake with the Lifesum app.

Next, the Breathe app has been a

popular way for people to take a

moment to be more mindful, and

now, the app is available as a

watch face, so with a simple

raise of the wrist, the watch

face will guide you through a

deep breath, and there are three

beautiful variations to choose

from.

It's a little hypnotic.

It's kind of wonderful.

In addition, we've created some

dynamic new watch faces that

uniquely interact with the shape

of the display.

With the fire face, see how the

flames subtly illuminate the

ticks of the dial?

And the new water face, notice

how the bubbles splash off the

edges.

And the vapor face, looks

amazing with the rich, vibrant

colors.

We think you're going to love

everything about the new

displays on Series 4.


Next, let's turn to the digital

crown.

The digital crown's been

completely reengineered, and it

now includes haptic feedback,

giving you a more responsive and

mechanical feel.

It's especially great in apps

like Podcast and Calendar where

you precisely flip through each

item.

The speaker has also been

completely redesigned.

It's 50 percent louder, which is

great for phone calls and walkie

talkie or Siri requests.

You ask Siri something on Series

4, and she comes back with

volume.

You just won't believe the sound

you get out of such a small

device.

We moved the microphone on

Series 4 to the opposite side,

as far away from the speaker as

possible to reduce echo, making

phone calls even clearer.

And the back of Series 4 is

absolutely beautiful.

It's made entirely of black

ceramic and sapphire crystal,

and it's not only beautiful,

it's highly functional.

Radio waves can now pass through

both the front and the back,

resulting in improved cellular

reception.

So this, along with a new

speaker and microphone, makes

Series 4 even better for staying

connected.

Series 4 is just as impressive

on the inside.

The brain of Series 4 is our

fourth-generation silicon in

package, or SIP, and we call it

S4, and it allows us to build in

so many capabilities in such a

small device.

S4 contains a powerful new

dual-core 64-bit processor and a

new GPO both custom designed by

our Apple silicon team to

deliver up to two times faster

performance.

On Apple Watch, the

accelerometer and gyroscope,

they power important experiences

like all-day activity tracking

or even identifying your swim

stroke.

Well Series 4 has a next

generation accelerometer and

gyroscope with twice the dynamic

range measuring up to 32 G

forces and can sample motion

data eight times faster.

You probably have no idea what

any of that means, but that's

okay because we do, and it's

allowed us to do something new.

One of the leading causes of

injuries worldwide is falls.

So whether your slip off a step

ladder or you trip on a curb, a

hard fall can be serious, and it

can be difficult to get

immediate help.

Well now Apple Watch Series 4

can detect a fall.

It's interesting, identifying a

fall may sound like a

straightforward problem, but it

requires a tremendous amount of

data and analysis.

We conducted studies with

thousands of people over a long

period of time, and we captured

data on real-world falls, and we

learned something.

We learned that with falls

there's this repeatable motion

pattern that happens.

For example, when you trip, your

body will naturally pitch

forward, and your arms will go

out involuntarily to brace

yourself.

However, if you slip, there's a

natural upward motion of the

arms.

Well these are motions Series 4

is ideally suited to recognize.

With the new accelerometer and

gyroscope, the watch analyzes

wrist trajectory and impact

acceleration to determine when a

fall occurs, and after detecting

a fall, Series 4 delivers an

alert, and from that alert, you

can initiate an emergency call.

However, if the watch senses you

are immobile for one minute, it

will start the call

automatically.

And it also sends a message with

your location to your emergency

contacts using the SOS feature

that is already built into Apple

Watch.

Fall detection is a feature that

we hope you never need, but it's

really nice to know it's there.

The optical heart sensor has

been essential to Apple Watch

from the beginning, and it

allows us to calculate the

calorie burned during your

workouts.

It allows to determine your

resting heart rate, and it also

powers the high heart rate

notification that's helped Apple

Watch become an intelligent

guardian for your health.

We wanted to do even more in

this space, and so we're

announcing three new heart

features.

First, a notification if your

heart rate appears to be too

low.

Now generally a low heart rate

is thought to be a good thing,

but if it's too low, it might

mean that your heart's not

pumping enough blood to the

body, and that can be a sign of

something serious, and now Apple

Watch can detect it.

The second feature is related to

heart rhythm, and this is a big

deal.

Apple Watch can now screen your

heart rhythm in the background,

and it sends you a notification

if it detects an irregular

rhythm that appears to be atrial

fibrillation.

Now, it won't catch every

instance of AFib, but we believe

this is going to help a lot of

people who didn't otherwise know

they had an issue.

The first two features, they're

powered by the optical sensor.

The third feature is made

possible by a new electrical

heart sensor on Series 4.

We've added electrodes into the

back sapphire crystal and the

digital crown allowing you take

an electrocardiogram.

It's otherwise known as an ECG,

and this is the first ECG

product offered over the counter

directly to consumers.

An ECG measures the electrical

activity of the heartbeat, and

it's used by physicians to help

diagnosis certain heart diseases

and other conditions.

And so now you can take an ECG

anytime, anywhere, right from

your wrist.

You just open the app, and you

put your finger on the digital

crown.

To show you how this works,

let's take a closer look.

The built-in electrodes in the

back crystal and the digital

crown, they detect electrical

impulses from the heartbeat.

They route them to the S4 chip,

which converts them to signal

for our algorithms.

The entire process takes just 30

seconds, and at the completion

of the ECG recording, you will

receive a heart rhythm

classification.

If your heart is beating in a

normal rhythm, the app will

classify the measurement as

sinus rhythm, and the app will

also classify atrial

fibrillation.

All ECG recordings, their

classifications, the noted

symptoms, they're all stored

right in the health app in a PDF

you can share with your doctor.

So now your doctor has a

detailed picture of your heart

rhythm, similar to a lead one

ECG that is usually only

obtained in the clinic.

And to give you his thoughts on

this, I'd like to invite to the

stage the president of the

American Heart Association, and

also a practicing cardiologist,

Dr. Ivor Benjamin.

Thank you, Jeff.

I'm inspired by the life-saving

potential of technology and

applaud Apple's innovation and

commitment to health.

Capturing meaningful data about

a person's heart in real time is

changing the way we practice

medicine.

In my experience, people often

report symptoms that are absent

during their medical visits.

That is why information is

vital, information about a

person's daily lifestyle choices

and their specific health data.

The ability to access health

data on on-demand

electrocardiogram or ECG is game

changing.

Especially when evaluating

atrial fibrillation and

irregular and often rapid heart

rate that can increase a

person's risk of stroke, heart

failure, and other

health-related complications.

At the American Heart

Association, we are committed to

educate and empower people, to

be proactive in all areas of

their health and general

well-being.

The American Heart Association

is a relentless force for a

world of longer, healthier

lives.

Products that seek to provide

deeper health insights like the

Apple Watch Series 4 offer great

potential in getting us there.

Thank you.

Back to you Jeff.

Thanks Dr. Benjamin.

It's great to have the support

of the American Heart

Association, and I'm also

pleased to say, we've received

clearance from the FDA.

And this is a de novo clearance,

which means it's the first of

its kind.

Also, the irregular heart rhythm

alert has also received FDA

clearance.

Both of these features will be

available to U.S. customers

later this year, and we're

working hard to bring them to

customers around the world.

I just have to show you when you

open the app, this is what you

see on the watch face.

It's really beautiful.

People in general don't like

things that are medical.

This kind of makes you want to

take an ECG.

It's amazing to think that the

same watch you wear every day to

make phone calls and respond to

messages, track your activity,

like even run a marathon can now

take an ECG.

Apple Watch Series 4 is the

ultimate guardian for your

health, the best fitness

companion, and the most

convenient way to stay

connected.

And with all these amazing

features, of course, your data

is still protected.

At Apple we believe your

personal information belongs to

you, you should decide who you

share it with, and who gets to

see it, period.

All your health and fitness

data, it's encrypted on device

and in cloud.

So Apple Watch Series 4, larger

display, brand new UI, digital

crown with haptics, up to two

times faster performance, a

louder speaker, fall detection,

and an industry first built-in

electrical heart sensor capable

of taking an ECG and of course

cellular, GPS, altimeter, swim

proof, and I probably missed

some things.

We also have the most advanced

wearable operating system watch

OS5.

So with all of these features in

a slimmer design, you're

probably wondering about battery

life.

Well, I'm pleased to tell you

that Series 4 has the same

18-hour, all-day battery life

that our customers enjoy on

Apple Watch.

And we've increased the outdoor

workout time to six hours, so

you can have full GPS tracking,

which is perfect for those

marathons or long bike rides.

And of course, Apple Watch has

been designed and manufactured

in an environmentally friendly

way.

We created a video about Series

4, and I'd like to show that to

you now.

Apple Watch Series 4 is more

than an evolution.

It represents a fundamental

redesign and reengineering of

Apple Watch.

While retaining the iconic

design, we've developed and

refined the form, also managing

to make it thinner.

The new display is now over 30

percent larger and is seamlessly

integrated into the product.

The interface has been

redesigned for our new display,

providing more information with

richer detail.

The hardware and the software

combine to define a very new and

truly integrated singular

design.

Navigating with the digital

crown, already one of the most

intricate mechanisms we've ever

created, has been entirely

reengineered with haptic

feedback delivering a precise

mechanical feel as you scroll.

In addition to an optical heart

sensor, there is a new

Apple-designed electrical heart

sensor that allows you to take

an electrocardiogram or ECG to

share with your doctor, a

momentous achievement for a

wearable device.

Placing a finger on the digital

crown creates a closed circuit

with electrodes on the back,

providing data the ECG app uses

to analyze your heart rhythm.

While understanding heart health

is essential to our well-being,

additional features and

enhancements encourage us to

live an overall healthier, more

active life.

The accelerometer, gyroscope,

and altimeter allow you to

record new types of workouts,

measure runs with increased

precision, and track your

all-day activity with great

accuracy.

Enhanced cellular connectivity

enables something truly

liberating, the ability to stay

connected with just your watch.

Phone calls, music streaming,

and even emergency assistance

are all immediately available

from your wrist.

Apple Watch Series 4 is a device

so powerful, so personal, so

liberating, it can change the

way you live each day.

Series 4 will be available in

three aluminum finishes, silver,

gold, and space gray, and the

stainless collection is

absolutely beautiful with

polished and space black.

We've shipped stainless before,

but there's something about

Series 4 that is even more

gorgeous, and there's a

brand-new finish, gold

stainless, which is wonderful

paired with this Milanese loop.

All band colors and band styles

fit any generation of Apple

Watch, so all those Series 4

customers, all the bands that

you already own will work just

fine on the Series 4.

For customers who love Nike

Plus, especially runners, it's

been optimized for Series 4 with

full-screen watch faces that

look great, and they've done

something really cool with the

Nike sport loop.

They've added reflective yarn

for night-time visibility.

Apple Watch Hermes continues

this Fall with some bold new

looks.

There's these gorgeous color

blocks on the watch face, and

they change with the passage of

time, and they look really

wonderful paired with the new

Double Tour bands.

Apple Watch Series 4 with GPS

starts at $399.

Series 4 with cellular starts at

$499, and we're keeping Series 3

in the line at more affordable

prices, starting at just $279.

Series 4 GPS will be available

in 26 markets at launch.

Series 4 with cellular will

start in 16 markets with 34

carriers, that's more than twice

the number of carriers we had

last year.

You can order Series 4 starting

Friday, and it will be available

the following Friday, September

21st.

Series 3 at the new prices is

available right after the show,

and watchOS 5, the most advanced

wearable operating system will

be available on September 17.

That's Apple Watch, and now back

to Tim.

Thanks Jeff.

Thank you.

I could not be more excited

about the Apple Watch Series 4.

Apple Watch is really redefining

what a watch can do for you.

Now we made a video about how

the Apple Watch is inspiring

people all around the world to

be more active, and I'd love to

run it for you now.

I think you're going to get a

kick out of it.

You put your right arm in,

you put your right arm out, you

put your right arm in, and you

shake it all about.

You do the hokey pokey and you

turn yourself around,

that's what it's all about.

Left foot.

You put your left foot in, you

put your left foot out, you put

your left foot in, and you shake

it all about.

Hey honey, let's go running.

You do the hokey pokey and

you turn yourself around,

that's what it's all about.

You put your left arm in, you

put your left arm out,

you put your left arm in,

and you shake it all about.

You do the hokey pokey and you

turn yourself around,

that's what it's all about.

Whole self.

You put your whole self in,

you put your whole self out,

you put your whole self in,

and you shake it all about.

You do the hokey pokey and you

turn yourself around,

that's what it's all about.

That's what it's all about.

That's what it's all about.

We really love what the Apple

Watch is doing to get the world

moving.

So that is Apple Watch.

Now let's talk about iPhone.

iPhone X defined the future of

the smartphone.

It introduced new technologies

that is at the cutting edge of

what's possible.

With a stunning, all-stream

design and intuitive gestures,

with technologies like the

TrueDepth camera system and Face

ID, where your phone knows what

you look like, and your face

becomes your password.

iPhone X has an incredible

camera system that uses

intelligent software to make the

most stunning portraits.

This was only previously

possible with pro-level

equipment.

And there are so many other

innovative technologies that are

built right in, and of course

all of them are powered by the

world's most advance mobile

operating system, iOS.

iPhone X has changed the

industry, and along the way, it

became the number one smartphone

in the world.

But what's most important to us

is that it's the most loved

smartphone with an amazing 98

percent customer satisfaction.

Now, today, we're going to take

iPhone X to the next level.

I'm excited to show you what is

by far the most advanced iPhone

we have ever created.

This is iPhone XS.

It is the most advance iPhone

we've ever created, and I'd like

to invite Phillip to tell you

all about it.

Phil.

Good morning everyone.

I am so excited to tell you all

about iPhone XS.

It is made of a surgical-grade

stainless steel.

It has a gorgeous new gold

finish on the front and on the

glass.

It is the most beautiful iPhone

we have ever made.

The screen goes top to bottom,

edge to edge, rounded into the

corners.

And it's covered on the front

and the back with a new

formulation of glass that is the

most durable glass ever in a

smartphone.

iPhone XS comes in three

finishes, gold, silver, and

space gray.

They are beautiful, and they're

protected from dust and liquids

to an even higher level now.

IP68, that means it's protected

to two meters for up to 30

minutes.

So if you happen to be hanging

by the pool, drop your phone in

the water, don't worry.

Dive down, grab it, rinse it,

let it dry, you'll be fine.

And the team tested it in my

different liquids, in

chlorinated water, salt water,

orange juice, tea, wine, even

beer.

This is some of the most fun,

intense testing we get to do at

Apple.

The screen on iPhone XS is a

Super Retina display, the best

we've made yet.

It's an OLED display, 5.8 inches

on the diagonal, and it's 2.7

million pixels, 458 pixels per

inch, the highest quality

display on an iOS device.

Now let's put it side by side

with our plus size phone, an

iPhone 8 Plus, and as you can

see, it's as big a display as

the plus size phone but in a

smaller design, and so many

customers love that about that,

big display, easy, comfortable

to hold in your hand.

And it looks incredible.

Watching movies on it, the

latest HDR movies like Lego

Batman, using the latest

formats, Dolby Vision, HDR10.

Your photos look stunning on

iPhone XS.

You shoot them with beautiful,

wide color, and they display

better than ever on the new

Super Retina display because it

has a 60 percent greater dynamic

range for colors in your photos

than the iPhone X's display.

It is gorgeous.

Well the iPhone XS is not just

one but two sizes of display,

the 5.8 inch and a new 6.5 inch

Super Retina display.

This is the biggest display ever

on an iPhone.

It is an OLED display as well,

3.3 million pixels, 458 pixels

per inch again.

Now a lot of our customers have

loved the plus size iPhone.

So let's put that side by side.

You can see, it's about the same

size phone with a much larger

display.

We think there are a lot of

customers who are going to love

this larger display.

Now, the 5.8 inch, we already

said was as big as a plus size

display, so what do you call a

phone that's bigger than plus

size?

Well, we call it the iPhone XS

Max.

And the Max is an incredible

experience.

Watching videos on it is

cinematic.

Looking at your photos bigger

than ever is incredible.

Surfing the web, looking at fly

overs in Map, even when you're

using some of the built-in apps,

the team's taken advantage of

the wider display when it's in

horizontal mode to give you a

split view like here in

contacts.

It's awesome for editing videos

in iMovie for creating songs

with Garage Band and even

playing immersive killer games

is so much fun on the iPhone XS

Max.

So, there are two Super Retina

displays now, 5.8 inch, 6.5

inch, both OLED displays, both a

million to one contrast ratio,

they're HDR displays.

They have fast 120 Hertz

touch-sensitive layer, that's

how it gets its smooth scrolling

really fast typing and gaming

response.

They both have 3D touch for

pressure sensitivity.

They have tap to wake.

They have incredible color

management.

They're true tone display, so

the paper white looks just right

in all the different lighting

that you use it, and they have

wide color.

These are amazing displays.

And we've matched them to

incredible sound systems as

well.

Stereo sound, better than in any

iPhone today.

Now, with the 10S, you get a

wider stereo field.

The team has matched powerful

speakers with great software to

deliver an even richer sound

experience.

So watching movies sounds

incredible.

And playing games, like Alto

Odyssey, which previously you

put on headphones.

Now you just want to listen

through the speakers because of

that beautiful wide stereo

sound.

Of course, listening to music

and watching music videos like

the Foo Fighters sounds better

than ever.

All right.

Let's talk about Face ID.

Face ID is a huge step forward

in biometric protection for all

of our personal data on our

devices, and customers love it.

It is powered by our TrueDepth

camera system.

And there's so much technology

in that little space right

there.

An infrared camera, flood

illuminator, proximity sensor,

ambient light sensor, dot

projector, front camera, speaker

and microphone, all working

together to give protection to

the data on our devices.

And they're designed with

multiple neural networks, so

it's secure and seamless in the

iPhone experience.

With iPhone XS, you just pick up

your iPhone, look at it, it

recognizes your face and unlocks

your notifications and

information.

And it does it faster than ever

before because the XS now has

faster algorithms and runs on a

faster version of the secure

enclave, so it's gotten even

better.

Face ID works remarkably well.

In fact, we're proud to say it

is the most secure facial

authentication ever in a

smartphone.

Powering Face ID in everything

we do on the iPhone is our A

series chip, and the team has

worked so hard to make every

generation of the A series chip

better than any and ever in a

smartphone, and this year is no

exception.

What the team has done is truly,

truly, breakthrough.

It's called the A12 Bionic.

And the A12 Bionic is the

industry's first seven nanometer

chip, and that's a huge

breakthrough, yes.

The A12 Bionic is packed with

6.9 billion transistors, and

what the team has done with all

that is remarkable.

So let's go through some of the

things in this chip.

We're going to talk about the

CPU, the GUP, and the neural

engine.

Let's start with the CPU.

It's an Apple designed 6-core

CPU, this is a fusion system.

It has two high-performance

cores, four high-efficiency

cores.

The two high-performance cores

run up to 15 percent faster than

the cores in the A11 Bionic

while also being 40 percent more

energy efficient.

And the high efficiency cores

are up to 50 percent more energy

efficient, and all six cores can

run at once.

The GPU, well this is an Apple

designed GPU.

It is so powerful.

Now the A11 GPU was already

ahead of anything else in the

industry.

The A12 GPU is now up to 50

percent faster than the A11, so

a huge jump in graphics

performance.

But the real advancement, the

real blow-away thing is this

neural engine.

Now you know we introduced the

first neural engine last year

with the A11 Bionic.

With the A12 Bionic, we take it

much further.

The A11 was a 2-core design.

This is an 8-core dedicated

machine-learning engine to power

all that great machine learning

software on our systems, and it

has a smart compute system.

What that means, it's able to

analyze the neural network data

and figure out on the fly

whether to run it on the CPU,

the GPU, or the neural engine.

I mean this is breakthrough, and

the performance is unmatched.

We told you last year that A11

Bionic could process an insane

600 billion operations per

second.

Well the A12 Bionic is able to

process 5 trillion operations

per second.

Unbelievable.

[ Applause ]

Now the A12 Bionic is a complete

system on a chip, so there's so

much more.

And the team works very hard to

be just as innovative at every

one of these things in the A12

Bionic.

It has a next generation image

single processor, incredible

video coders and decoders.

There's our display engine, our

audio system.

Of course, it has a secure

enclave.

It has memory controllers,

storage controllers.

The Apple designed storage

controller and the A12 Bionic

can now address twice as much

internal storage as previously.

So now you can have up to 512

gigabytes of internal storage if

you want.

That's a half a terabyte on your

iPhone in your pocket.

That's enough for over 200,000

photos stored on your iPhone.

It is incredible.

[ Applause ]

This A12 Bionic is without

question the smartest and most

powerful chip ever in a

smartphone.

[ Applause ]

So much of the experience we

have with iPhone is driven by

this chip, and it's going to

enable us to have so many great

new experiences not possible

before.

So I'm very excited to bring out

Kaiann Drance to show you just

what we can do with iPhone and

Kaiann is our senior director of

iPhone product marketing.

Kaiann.

[ Applause ]

>> Thank you, Phil, thank you.

[ Applause ]

A12 Bionic was designed for

iPhone, not any other

smartphone.

This is one smartphone.

This is one of the reasons why

our team can deliver a chip

design for incredible

performance, great battery life

for everything iPhone needs,

from our everyday tasks to our

most advanced technologies, such

as every time you look at your

phone and unlock it with Face

ID, or playing an immersive game

on our edge-to-edge Super Retina

display and each time you take a

remarkable photo.

Every single thing you do

touches the chip, the CPU, the

GPU, or any other powerful

component all throughout, best

in class, and designed for

iPhone for the very best

performance.

So, next time you unlock your

phone, perhaps launch photos,

searching through the thousands

of photos you have to find just

the one you're looking for,

deciding how to share it amongst

different apps such as messages,

and then moving onto the next

thing, with multitasking,

perhaps landing in Maps to find

direction.

A12 Bionic makes these everyday

tasks feel fast and effortless.

And, A12 Bionic with the

performance updates in iOS 12

helps apps launch up to 30

percent faster.

So we're focused on these

everyday experiences, but even

beyond that, such as those that

make use of machine learning.

Now, we've used machine learning

for a number of years now to

make our features even better,

such as quick type suggestions

in messages, in memories, how we

curate your photos and videos,

getting real-time suggestions in

Maps when you need them, our

true-tone adaptive display, and

of course finding the very best

photo of your cat or other pet.

But what's really remarkable

this year is that our next

generation neural engine unlocks

the power of real-time machine

learning.

This is incredibly important for

apps like camera, and we use

that depth information for

portrait mode and portrait

lighting.

In Animoji, mapping those 50

different facial muscles over

your face in a live Facetime

call.

That is computationally really

intense.

And of course our immersive AR

experiences, our fun new Memoji,

and the new Clicks app launching

this fall will make use of

portrait segmentation on the

neural engine for even better

selfie scenes, like the one you

see here in Incredibles 2.

At iOS 12 we're also announcing

and launching Siri shortcuts, so

you can get even more done with

just a tap or by asking Siri to

help.

You can easily create a shortcut

with multiple steps, like the

one I used this morning.

Let's take a look.

I just press and hold or ask

Siri to run my keynote day

shortcut.

Now the first you'll do, it'll

kick off my HomeKit enabled

accessories, then it'll order my

morning coffee.

And it'll tell me how long it

takes for me to go pick it up.

And then it will kick off the

reminder I set to not forget my

badge, get me driving

directions, and start my music

playlist, and here we go.

And this is just one of many

things that you can do with Siri

shortcuts.

We're really excited this year

to be opening up our neural

engine to Core ML, and Core ML

is going to get a lot faster.

It's going to get up to nine

times faster.

But it's going to run with as

little as one-tenth the energy.

This is tremendous.

It means developers can run

their most complex, most

advanced neural networks in

their apps and do so even more

often.

Then freeing up the power of a

GPU for more immersive graphics

like never before, which by the

way is really useful for

augmented reality, and this is

another area that we're focused

on.

That camera view finder has

turned into a wonderful window

to these new AR experiences,

such as this app here called

Fishing Go, that lets you turn

your surroundings into this

immersive marine aquarium where

you can discover more than 200

species of sea life.

iPhone XS is the best platform

for AR.

We custom calibrate our cameras

and sensors for the best AR

experience.

In A12 Bionic, the GPU helps us

render realistic graphics, the

ISP for real-world lighting, and

the neural engine for object

reflections and more.

And it joins the best AR

software with ARKit 2, where

apps can access enhanced surface

and object detection, persistent

experiences, multiple users, and

we've even included a new

Measure app built-in.

And with AR Quick Look, you can

look at a 3D object like this

one here in Safari and with just

a tap bring it out into the real

world.

Isn't that amazing?

So you've heard some examples

today of how A12 Bionic is

accelerating real-world everyday

scenarios but also enabling new

experiences, but it doesn't end

with us.

It also extends out to our

talented pool of developers and

that wonderful ecosystem where

they have access to the best

software with iOS 12 and the A12

Bionic.

This takes us to the next

generation of apps, and we're

thrilled to have three

developers here today to show

you what's possible in just a

short amount of time.

Now, our first developer is

making use of the CPU and GPU to

take their game to the next

level of impact.

Please welcome Todd Howard, game

director of Bethesda Game

Studios.

Thanks Kianne.

Thank you.

You know, I wrote my first game

when I was 12 on an Apple 2, and

I got to tell you, I took full

advantage of every single one of

those low res 40 x 40 pixels.

And it's amazing how far we've

come.

With the technology that is

packed into our phones, we can

now start reaching for games

that are more than simple

diversions but experiences that

can truly transport you.

And with the new iPhone, we've

been able to do just that.

Let's take a look at our new

Elder Scrolls game, Blades.

Like series is known for, it is

a massive, first-person

role-playing game full of

stories, quests, and an

incredible world to explore.

You play one of the blades, the

empire's elite warriors, and

you'll define your own character

and how you want to engage in

combat.

You can use defense, melee, or

magic.

And on the iPhone's OLED screen,

we can pull out all of the

detail that you'd usually miss

in the bright and the dark

areas.

You can see the lighting from

these crystals bloom, reflect

off of the water.

We can have that lighting bounce

off of the walls.

And we can even have it reflect

off of your sword.

Additionally, we can use the new

stereo widening on the iPhone so

you can hear the forest around

you, all without headphones.

And scenes like this used to

only be possible in your living

room on a high-end gaming

console.

We can do them now on your phone

while doing full-screen

post-processing, all while

rendering 40 percent faster than

before.

You'll see the sword follows

Craig's specific movements and

timings.

It feels incredible, and that

new depth of field camera effect

really lets you focus your

actions during combat.

And spiders are just terrifying.

We've been able to pull off some

incredible environments that

just weren't possible before.

Twelve-year-old me would not be

able to comprehend all of these

pixels, all 2.7 million of them.

As we [inaudible] we can use the

power of the phone to bring all

those parts together, the

visuals, the sound, and even

haptic feedback on your attacks.

It's not just immersive.

It transports you.

You may have fought dragons in

Skyrim, but you've never

experienced the Elder Scrolls

like this and on your phone.

Blades is coming to iOS this

Fall.

It's available for preorder

right now.

We'll see you out there.

Thank you, Todd.

Now our next developer is going

to enable an entirely new use

case for the iPhone camera using

Core ML.

Here's David Lee, CEO of

NexTeam, and Steve Nash,

two-time NBA MVP and a new

member of the Basketball Hall of

Fame.

Thanks Kianne.

HomeCourt is an app that used

Core ML to track basketball

shots by simply pointing your

iPhone at a court.

When I was young and learning

the game, I never really knew if

I was doing the right things to

improve my game.

I would spend hours and hours

shooting by myself, just hoping

I was refining the techniques

that would take me to the next

level.

I've been working closely with

the HomeCourt team on a tool

that will revolutionize

basketball training, and I can't

wait to show you what we can do

with the new iPhone.

We couldn't bring a

basketball court here, so we

went out last week and saw Steve

training an athlete.

We now have a screen recording

of our app on a new iPhone.

Let's take a look.

The app recognizes the hoop and

the court automatically.

Tap start, it will start

tracking real-time shot

attempts, the makes indicated by

the dot on the floor and misses

by the red X's drawn as an

overlay right on the court.

With the new iPhone and Core ML

2 we see a massive performance

game that allows us to do a lot

more.

The powerful A12 Bionic models run up to

nine times faster, and that

unlocks new features that were

not possible before.

Let's take a look at what's

going on under the hood.

Only on a new iPhone we can run

real-time player tracking,

real-time post estimation,

real-time ball detection, and

trajectory estimation all at the

same time.

We call this real-time shot

science, that tracks six metrics

for every single shot the player

takes.

These insights are not visible

to the naked eye.

To become a great shooter,

you need to practice every day.

You need to shoot at game speed

and with the right posture.

I focus my students on staying

low and stable when they shoot.

HomeCourt is giving players

immediate feedback to help them

understand if they are

practicing with the right form.

Release time is also a great

indicator of whether the player

is shooting at game speed while

staying low.

These meaningful insights and

feedback just weren't possible

before.

Where you see that release

time from the set, it will be

displayed on screen, and app can

also give audio feedback for the

stereo speaker or

your earbuds.

As players train with

real-time feedback, they build

muscle memory.

I really wish that when I was

younger we had these tools.

HomeCourt is great for every

basketball player who wants to

get better, whether you're a

beginner or a pro.

The most amazing part is this

is all done with just your new

iPhone.

There are no sensors on the

player, no sensor on the ball,

and no sensor on the court, and

that's HomeCourt real-time shot

science, shipping as an update

this Fall.

Thank you.

Thank you Dave and Steve.

Wow, that was something.

Okay. So our third app makes use

of AR to do even more in a game.

Here is Atli Mar, CEO of

Directive Games.

Thanks Kianne.

Playing with friends at the

arcades has always been a lot of

fun.

Generations of gamers have

enjoyed countless hours playing

some of the world's best titles.

And now in AR, we are able to

have our own arcade cabinet

wherever and whenever we want.

And with ARKit 2, multiple

players are able to share the

same AR experiences.

Joining me here are my friends,

and they are eager to climb the

leader boards.

Andrea, Shai-Hi, Alessandra.

Are you guys ready?

We're ready to battle, Atli.

This is Galaga AR.

Just like the classic, you

eliminate your enemies, you

avoid being attacked, and you

grab power ups.

With the digital GPU Core, we

are able to render scenes like

the sun effect.

This is something that we could

not do before.

And the new iPhone stereo

widening makes things sound

really immersive.

Just listen to this epic

battle.

Last year, we shipped our first

AR game, and now, with new

features of ARKit 2 and the

power of the new iPhone, we are

able to craft experiences at a

much higher fidelity as well as

connect players both digitally

and in the physical world.

Look for the first game in our

AR arcade series on the App

Store later this year.

Thank you.

Wow. Wow.

We can't wait for you guys to

experience those apps and games.

This is really just the

beginning.

We're scratching the surface of

what's going to be possible on

the iPhone XS and the A12

Bionic.

No other chip in the world would

allow us to do this.

Thank you and now back to Phil.

Thank you, Kianne.

The A12 Bionic just powers so

many incredible new experiences,

and that includes the camera.

We all love the cameras in our

iPhone.

No doubt, you all know it is the

world's most popular camera and

for great reason.

Over ten years customers have

been taking incredible

photographs with their iPhone

cameras like this and sharing

them with us around the world

and telling us stories with

them.

And we're so proud of all the

people who use the iPhone camera

from consumers to even

increasingly professionals are

using them for photos like this.

This is a beautiful portrait

photo, but what makes us so

proud of it is that it appeared

on the cover of Time Magazine.

And this is their issue for

women who are changing the

world, and we couldn't be

prouder to be a part of that

story.

Well, you are going to be blown

away with the pictures you can

take with the iPhone XS's

camera.

It is a remarkable new

dual-camera system.

It has a 12-megapixel wide

camera, a 12-megapixel telephone

camera, and an even more

improved true-tone flash.

The 12-megapixel wide camera has

a new sensor, a larger sensor

with bigger, deeper pixels.

It has optical image

stabilization and our fast 1.8

aperture lens.

It's Apple's six-element lens.

The telephoto camera is also a

12-megapixel camera, also

optical image stabilization,

F2.4, Apple design lens.

On the front side, we have the

true-depth camera system, and

that's a new sensor as well.

A 7-megapixel sensor that's

twice as fast, and it works

together with the IR camera and

the dot projector, so it can

create depth in your

portrait-mode photos.

And as we talk about cameras, of

course everyone talks about the

sensors and the lens and rightly

so.

They're an important part of the

camera system.

But increasingly what makes

incredible photos possible

aren't just the sensor and the

lens, but it's the chip and

software that runs on it.

And this is so true with iPhone

photography.

So, for example, in the A12

Bionic is the image signal

processor, working together with

the CPU.

And it does so many things every

time we take a picture.

It automatically sets exposure,

white balance, sets the focus,

does noise reduction and low

light photography.

It brings out highlights and

details, and it can fuse

multiple images together like

when you do an HDR photo or

create a beautiful panorama.

And the ISP and the A12 Bionic

does all of this better than

ever before, but what it does

that is entirely new is connect

together the ISP with that

neural engine to use them

together to make our photos

incredible.

So, for example, the CPU, and

the neural engine can work

together to do detection of

people's faces and bodies, to

understand the scene that you're

shooting, and can do facial

landmarking.

So it recognizes exactly where

the eyes are and does instant

red eye reduction that looks

perfect.

And it creates better

segmentation masks so even with

portrait mode the hair and the

glasses are better than ever

before.

This is an amazing amount of

power for our camera team.

In fact, when you take a photo,

it's capable of doing a trillion

operations on every photo you

take.

And what the team is doing with

that power is truly remarkable.

We have a brand-new feature we

call Smart HDR.

And we all know what HDR is,

right.

You can take a couple photos and

merge them together to bring out

highlight and shadows and keep

your subject looking great.

Well, Smart HDR takes this idea

so much further.

So let's say you're taking a

picture, and the camera

recognizes you're shooting a

subject and the subject is

moving, you go to press down on

the shutter and you get a

picture instantly.

It's called zero shutter lag.

What the A12 Bionic is actually

doing is shooting a four-frame

buffer so it can capture that

critical moment.

The A12 Bionic is doing even

more than that.

It's also capturing secondary

interframes at the same time,

and those interframes are shot

at a different exposure level to

bring out highlight details.

And it's doing more than that.

It's shooting a long exposure so

we can get better shadow detail

as well.

And when you're taking that

picture, it's analyzing all of

those, finding out how to match

up the best parts of each and

merge them into one perfect

photo.

That's Smart HDR.

It is a breakthrough, and it

makes taking photos easier than

ever and to get beautiful

results.

So let me show you a few photos

shot with iPhone XS, not

retouched in any way, no

exterior lighting used, anything

else.

It's just straight from the

camera.

So here's one.

I mean this is stunning.

You're subject beautifully lit

with natural light, beautiful

skin tones, great detail, and a

nice beautiful soft background.

But what's remarkable about this

photo is it was a windy day by

the water, and her hair was

blowing.

Yet you still get that

incredible detail in her hair on

this Smart HDR photo.

Here's another example.

As you can see, this is what

you're not supposed to do,

right, shooting a photo into the

sun, because that's going to

blow out the exposure.

But Smart HDR makes sure we got

a great sky, we got detail on

the shadows of the water, but

most of all, look at the water

drops coming off of his hair and

how crisp and detailed they are.

That's incredible.

All your photos come out so much

better now with iPhone XS no

matter what your subject matter,

people, pets.

Look at the skin detail and the

hair and the beautiful sky.

Like we said, it shoots wide

color photos as well.

Look at the color range on this

photo.

Shot straight off iPhone XS.

And it looks even better with

the higher dynamic range display

on the iPhone XS when you look

at it there.

We introduced portrait mode and

portrait lighting photos.

Those are better than ever

before, and here's an example.

It's incredible the level of

detail.

This is the stage light feature

and the portrait lighting.

It looks so beautiful.

Here's another portrait lighting

photo, excuse me, portrait mode

photo.

Beautiful soft background.

These are better than ever

before, and there's a huge

advancement here.

Remember the area on the

background of the photo, the

quality of that blur is what the

industry calls bokeh.

And the team wanted to make a

big advancement in what can be

done with bokeh, and they've

done some amazing work here.

They studied some of the

highest-end full-frame cameras

and expensive fast lenses to

characterize the quality of

professional bokeh and then

bring that capability to more

and more of us through the

portrait mode photos that we can

take with iPhone, and what

they've achieved is really

breakthrough.

So I'm going to show you a photo

now, and I'll just tell you

right up front, this was not

shot with a high-end expensive

camera.

This was shot with an iPhone XS,

and it is breakthrough.

It is absolutely beautiful.

The detail on her face, the

great skin tones, obviously

reflecting from the surface of

the car to light it up, but that

background, and the quality of

that bokeh is remarkable.

This is a breakthrough in

photography for a smartphone.

But further than that, the team

discovered something remarkable.

This is so, so exciting.

I can't tell if you can tell I'm

excited about this, but this

is-- so when you take the

picture with portrait mode, and

then you go in to the photos

app, and you tap edit, you're

going to see a new slider on the

bottom that says depth.

Yeah, someone said no.

Get ready for this, because let

me blow it up, you're going to

have to watch two things at

once.

You're going to watch the depth,

and you're going to watch the

background.

You can, after taking the

picture, adjust the depth of

field, so that's 1.4, that's 16.

And the background is changing

with it.

Let's do that again.

We're going to slide a depth of

field, and watch the background

as it changes the depth of field

of your photo.

This is done after you've taken

it.

This has not been possible in

photography with any kind of

camera.

This is something that iPhone

can now do with the power of the

A12 Bionic chip.

Let me show you one more

example.

Here's another photo shot with

iPhone XS, and we see a

beautiful background with

incredible higher quality bokeh,

and as we looked at it, we slide

and we selected f2.0 because we

thought it had just the right

depth of field we want in the

photo.

This is a new era of

photography.

Some people call it

computational photography.

With a power of not only the

sensor and the lens, but the A12

Bionic and incredible software

and the care the camera team has

put to creating high-quality

photography is making images

possible now that weren't

before.

And the benefits of this, not

only for photography, but for

video as well, it's a new era of

videography as well, but this

new sensor and the power of that

A12 Bionic chip.

And it can do many things.

It has a twice as fast sensor.

It can take advantage of a lot

of this technology to give

better image quality in our

videos.

And there's something else the

team has done too.

Taking advantage of the four

microphones built into iPhone

XS, you can record stereo sound

with your videos as well.

And it plays back with that

beautiful wide stereo field, and

it sounds amazing.

So let me show you a quick video

that was shot with iPhone XS,

just natively shot on it,

nothing done to it other than we

edit it for length, and it's

shot in low light, and it

creates images that weren't

possible before.

Here we are.

Hey, what's up.

You made it up here.

Yeah. Had a little drive in.

And that's a beautiful video.

You just shoot it, 4K, but

there's a lot going on that the

system is doing for us.

Autofocus, auto exposure,

bringing up the highlight

details, the shadow details with

wider dynamic range, amazing

color rendering and tone mapping

and stereo sound being recorded

automatically.

So that's photography.

That's video.

That's our camera.

Now I'll talk about battery

life.

Increasingly, all smart phone

users want more performance,

bigger screens, but longer

battery life too.

The teams really worked hard on

this.

iPhone XS is able to compared to

iPhone X get you up to 30

minutes longer in your day than

iPhone X did, and that's really

great.

iPhone XS Max has the biggest

battery we've ever put into an

iPhone, and it can get you up to

an hour and a half longer in

your day.

And there's a lot more new with

iPhone XS and XS Max.

Faster networking, gigabit-class

LTE.

They have more bands than any

other smartphone, so they have

the best worldwide roaming and

speaking of worldwide

capabilities, one thing we've

had requests for is dual SIM

capability.

Well some of you know what this

is for.

For the rest, here are some

reasons people want dual SIM.

Some people want two phone

numbers on their phone.

Maybe a home number and a work

number.

Some want two different plans

depending on the region of the

world they're in and what they

need.

And many of us like to travel

and want to keep our local phone

number but may need to get a

data plan in a region we're in

so we can have access to fast

data there.

To do this, into iPhone XS and

XS Max, we built a technology

called DSDS, or Dual SIM Dual

Standby.

This means that you have both

phone numbers there in your

phone waiting to get call,

whichever one gets it becomes

the active line.

And to enable that, the we've

added our eSIM technology.

eSIM is a standard that we've

been working with carriers to

promote around the world.

We've actually already been

shipping it in cellular iPads,

in cellular watches, and now

we're bringing it to iPhone.

So with eSIM it's built in, easy

to set up a second line.

You can point your camera at a

QR code from a carrier and set

it up, and the team has worked

to make sure in the software

that the fact that you have two

different phone numbers is

understood.

And you can name them home and

work, primary and secondary,

whatever.

And then throughout the user

experience, you'll see that a

phone call is coming in on a

certain line, and you know how

to deal with that.

Support for eSIM requires

support from carriers, and we've

been working with many great

carrier partners, and they're

going to be rolling out eSIM

support throughout the fall and

many more into next year.

We're really, really happy to be

working with them on this.

So that's how we provide dual

SIM support around the world.

We will have a single physical

SIM and a eSIM in both iPhone XS

and XS Max.

In China, where we can't bring

eSIM into iPhone yet, we're

making a special model of the

iPhone XS Max that has two

physical SIMs, actually one on

each side of the SIM tray.

It's a really smart

implementation, and we think

they're going to love that.

So this is iPhone XS and XS Max.

They are packed with so many new

advancements.

Better Super Retina displays,

5.8 inch and the new 6.5 inch

OLED displays.

Our next generation 7 nanometer

A12 Bionic chip with faster CPU,

GPU, neural engine, and helping

us to deliver even longer

battery life.

Our new generation dual camera

system with a bigger sensor,

Smart HDR, portrait mode with

more beautiful bokeh, dynamic

depth of field, higher quality

videos with HD and 4K, new

true-depth camera system that's

faster for Face ID,

gigabit-class LTE, beautiful new

gold finish, protection to IP68

and so much more.

These are incredible new

iPhones.

And the team works really hard

to make these iPhones in the

most environmentally friendly

manner possible.

And to tell you a little bit

more about that, I'm really

excited to bring out Lisa.

Thanks Phil.

You know, we never stop thinking

about what's best for the

planet.

This starts with our products,

but it extends to everything we

do at Apple.

So, for instance, earlier this

year we announced something

pretty amazing.

You may have heard about it

already, but we can't help

repeating ourselves because we

now run Apple on 100 percent

renewable energy at all of our

facilities worldwide.

Now of course that includes the

gorgeous campus that we're on

right now.

It's powered by our own solar

panels and directed biogas fuel

cells.

But it's also about the

facilities that you don't often

see, like our data centers,

which use lots of clean energy

to support services, like

iMessage.

And that means every time you

send an iMessage or make a

Facetime video call, we're using

lots of clean energy to make

that happen.

Now when we set out to do this,

people said it couldn't be done.

And if you know Apple, those are

exactly the kinds of challenges

that we love.

So we've done it, and we're

really really proud of it.

And now, we're on to the next

challenge.

We hope to one day eliminate our

need to mine new materials from

the Earth.

Now as you can imagine, this is

a massive effort.

So to reach that goal, we have

to do three things.

First, we'll have to find new

ways to make our products with

recycled or renewable materials

that are sourced responsibly.

Then we'll have to ensure that

our products last as long as

possible.

And then finally after a long

life of use, we have to ensure

that they're recycled properly.

So let's take a look at some of

the material innovations within

the new iPhones that we've just

announced.

We've transitioned to using

recycled tin in the main logic

board of iPhone including the

new iPhone XS, and of course

this is with no reduction in

quality or performance.

This one change will prevent the

mining of over 10,000 tons of

tin ore in a single year.

And we're doing this with other

materials as well.

We have a better plastics

program, and through that we're

reducing our use of traditional

plastics and transitioning to

recycled and bio-based

materials.

For example, the speaker

enclosure for iPhone XS is now

made with 35 percent

post-consumer recycled plastic.

And the cover glass frame is

made with 32 percent bio-based

plastic.

It's better for the planet, but

it's also tougher and it

performs better.

Second, we also make sure to

design and build durable

products that last as long as

possible.

That means long-lasting hardware

coupled with our amazing

software.

All of these devices, including

the iPhone 5S run iOS 12 and iOS

12 is designed to make your

iPhone and iPad experience even

better, even more responsive,

faster, just better, and because

they last longer, you can keep

using them, and keeping using

them is the best thing for the

planet.


And finally, when it comes time

to reuse and recycle, we have

Apple GiveBack.

This is something I'm really

proud of.

With Apple GiveBack, it doesn't

matter what device you have or

what condition it's in, bring it

in or mail it into us.

We'll assess it, and if it can

be used by someone else, we'll

give you the value.

If not, we'll recycle it

properly for free.

Maybe we'll even use the robot.

Who remembers Liam?

Well meet his sister, Daisy, who

can disassemble nine different

models of iPhone.

Using Daisy, we can reuse those

recycled materials in future

products, and the more we do

this, the less we'll have to

mine from the Earth.

So that iPhone 5S, with Apple

GiveBack, it can go on to

another user when you're ready

to switch to a new iPhone.

And when it comes to the new

iPhone XS, you can feel

confident that it too was

designed for another long life

of use.

Either way, it's good for you,

but it is a huge win for the

planet.

Thank you.

Thank you, Lisa.

This work is really important to

all the teams at Apple, and it's

a great example of the

collaboration between all the

teams to do everything from

reducing the amount of tin in

products to the GiveBack

program.

Just great work and we're really

proud of everything they do.

So, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max,

they are stunning, the best

iPhones we've ever made by a

long shot.

We are so excited about the

technologies in here, the

experiences they're going to

bring to people, and we hope

customers love them just as much

as we do.

We want to reach as many

customers as we can with this

incredible technology.

So that's why we are very

excited to show you one more

iPhone.

It is incredible, and we are so

excited to introduce you to the

iPhone XR.

And we hope it reaches even more

customers with this amazing,

incredible technology.

It's made from a 7000 series

aerospace grade aluminum and has

more durable glass.

It is absolutely stunning.

It comes in incredible new

finishes, white, black, blue,

coral, yellow, each beautifully

designed with that aluminum

finish, the glass in the back.

The screen goes edge to edge and

top to bottom.

There's even an incredible

product red one as well, and it

is beautiful.

All of these are protected from

dust and liquids to IP67.

They're designed end to end with

the most incredible technology.

This display is really what

strikes you though.

It's an LCD display that for the

first time goes edge to edge.

It took advanced new engineering

and technology to do pixel

masking and pixel [inaudible]

and to have LEDs that fit into a

smaller space than ever before.

This is the most advanced LCD

ever in a smartphone.

And it's so cool we had to give

it its own cool new name, it's

called the Liquid Retina

display.

The Liquid Retina display is 6.1

inches on the diagonal.

Now let's bring, well first it's

1.4 million pixels, and it's 326

pixels per inch.

So true retina image quality.

Now let's bring that iPhone 8

Plus next to is, because it's

really interesting.

It is a bigger display than the

iPhone 8 Plus in a smaller

design.

The design actually fits

perfectly between the sides of

an 8 and an 8 Plus, so we think

it's going to make a lot of

customers really happy.

So a 6.1 inch Liquid Retina

display, an LCD display, 1.4

million pixels.

It supports tap to wake.

It has that 120 Hertz

touch-sensitive layer, so it

scrolls super-fast.

It has great color management,

color accuracy.

It has a wide color display, and

it has true tone support.

So the whites look paper white

in all the lights you use them.

And it is an iPhone X experience

on an LCD display.

So that means you tap it to wake

it up.

There's no home button.

You swipe up to go to the home

screen, a first for an LCD

display.

Swipe down to get your

notifications.

Swipe down to get to control

center from the right corner.

It doesn't have 3D touch, but

here again the team came up with

something really smart.

It has a new feature we call

haptic touch.

So to get to the camera from the

home screen, we just press on

it.

You feel a haptic tap, and

you're taken right to the

camera.

This is a similar technology to

what we do with the track pad in

the Mac Book Pro that we all

love so much.

It is a great experience.

And like every iPhone X new

experience, it has Face ID.

And there's a TrueDepth camera

system, the same TrueDepth

camera system in iPhone XS and

XS Max.

So it's an infrared camera,

flood illuminator, proximity

sensor, ambient light sensor,

dot projector, front camera,

speaker and microphone.

All the technology to have an

incredible Face ID experience.

So you look at iPhone XR to

unlock it.

You look at it to pay with Apple

Pay.

And like iPhone XS and XS Max,

it's faster but it's faster

algorithms, running on a faster

secure enclave.

And inside the iPhone XR is

nothing but the best chip we

make, our brand new seven

nanometer A12 Bionic chip.

So this is a powerhouse, faster

CPU, faster GPU, faster neural

engine, and it can do all of

those experiences that Kianne

showed you earlier, including

real-time machine learning.

It is an incredible new phone.

And it has a great new camera

system as well.

It's a single camera system, our

best single camera system that

we've ever made.

It's a 12 megapixel, wide-angle

camera, the exact same

wide-angle camera in the XS and

XS Max, so it's our new

generation sensor that's larger

with bigger pixels, optical

image stabilization, twice as

many focus pixels, faster f1.8

aperture, Apple designed lens,

and the new improved true tone

flash as well.

And it takes beautiful photos.

Like this one.

So this was taken from an iPhone

XR.

It is stunning.

Incredible detail, beautiful

tone mapping.

There's probably something

you've noticed about this photo

though.

It's a portrait mode photo with

that beautiful background blur,

taken from a single camera

system.

This is remarkable.

What the team is able to do is

combine hardware and software to

create a depth segmentation map

using the focus pixels and

neural net software so that we

can create portrait mode photos

on the brand-new iPhone XR.

Here's another example.

Just incredible, beautiful,

beautiful focus on the subject,

great lighting, beautiful

background bokeh.

Yes, it gets the same advanced

bokeh technology we talked about

with iPhone XS and XS Max, and

it gets depth control

dynamically after you've taken

the picture.

So all that breakthrough

features and capabilities that

you want are right here.

Here are some other photo

examples taken from iPhone XR.

They are absolutely beautiful.

It has Smart HDR as well.

Helps to bring out highlights

and shadows even in low-light

photos.

It has wide color as well, so

you get stunning, beautiful,

rich color photographs.

On the front side is the same

TrueDepth camera system as

iPhone XS and XS Max with its

latest technology so you get

full support for portrait mode

and portrait lighting.

It can take some of the best

selfies you've ever seen.

These are shot off the TrueDepth

camera on iPhone XR.

Well what about battery life?

Well here the story continues to

be just great because

performance in this big screen,

the team has worked hard to give

great battery life.

So let's compare it to the

iPhone 8 Plus.

So many customers love the long

battery life of that.

Well iPhone XR gives you up an

hour and a half more in your day

than the iPhone 8 Plus.

So this is the brand new iPhone

XR.

It has a 6.1 inch Liquid Retina

display, an LCD display, the

most advanced ever in the

industry.

It is our latest seven nanometer

A12 Bionic chip with its faster

CPU and GPU and that

breakthrough neural engine and

helping to deliver even longer

battery life.

It is the best single camera

system we've ever made with our

new generation 12 megapixel

sensor with support for Smart

HDR, portrait modes with

beautiful bokeh, dynamic depth

control, incredible video.

It has the same TrueDepth camera

system as iPhone XS and XS Max

with faster Face ID and on and

on.

These six beautiful new

finishes, that incredible 7000

Series aerospace grade aluminum

and IP67 protection from liquids

and dust.

IPhone XS, XS Max, and iPhone XR

have arsenic-free display glass,

mercury-free displays, BFR-free,

PVC-free, beryllium-free.

They're designed and

manufactured with a low-carbon

process, and they're highly

recyclable.

We're so proud of all that work

the team does.

This is a huge day for iPhone.

We now have iPhone XS, XS Max,

and XR, three new models of

iPhone.

We have a product video about it

to tell you a little bit more,

and they're amazing.

The iPhone X described our

vision for the future of the

smartphone.

Today, we're extending that

vision with significant advances

across three entirely new

products.

iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and

iPhone XR.

iPhone XS is completely

uncompromising.

The expansive, Super Retina

display with OLED delivers vivid

brightness, true blacks, and

high dynamic range content.

iPhone XS Max has the largest

display ever on an iPhone.

Custom developed stainless steel

is precisely machined to create

structural bands in three

finishes, including new gold.

With even better water and dust

resistance, this structure is

integrated with the most durable

glass ever developed for a

smartphone.

Face ID enabled by the TrueDepth

camera system reinvents the way

to securely unlock login and pay

with only a glance.

Now it's even faster.

The A12 Bionic chip is the

smartest and most powerful chip

ever in a smartphone.

It's next generation neural

engine dedicates machine

learning to everything from

augmented reality to

photography.

With a more advanced dual camera

system and neural engine, iPhone

is again taking us to a new era

of photography where even more

capable sensors are combined

with lenses, chips, and advanced

software delivering Smart HDR

across your photos, creating

images like never before.

Portrait mode on both the back

camera and front TrueDepth

camera now features more

nuanced, software enhanced,

adjustable depth of field.

4K video with better low-light

performance, and extended

dynamic range now records in

stereo, and your content plays

back in widened stereo sound.

iPhone XR integrates the same

breakthrough technologies.

It's powered by the same A12

Bionic chip, has the same

versatile TrueDepth camera with

the same advanced Face ID.

An entirely new range of

finishes are enable by

precision-machined, structural

aluminum band, anodized to

complement an all-glass

enclosure.

The all-screen Liquid Retina

display is the most advanced LCD

in a smartphone and the most

color accurate in the industry.

A new back light design allows

the display to extend into the

radius corners, enabling a

larger LCD than ever before.

The advanced single camera

system combined with machine

learning allows iPhone XR to

recognize people, map subjects,

and add depth.

The depth of field is

adjustable, so you can take more

dramatic portraits.

Our utterly uncompromised vision

for the future, iPhone XS and

iPhone XS Max, and with a range

of new finishes offering more

choice to more people, iPhone

XR.

Thank you.

Well iPhone XR will come in six

finishes and in three sizes, 64

gigabytes, 128 gigabytes, and

256 gigabytes of storage, and it

will start at $749.

So that's less expensive than

the iPhone 8 Plus.

I'm really proud of the work the

team has done on that.

You can order it in just over a

month, October 19th, and it will

start to ship a week later than

that, October 26th.

IPhone XS will come in three

configurations, 64 gigs, 256

gigs, and that new 512-gigabyte

storage capacity.

It starts at $999.

The iPhone XS Max, same three

configurations with its larger

screen, larger battery, just

$100 more, starting at $1099.

The iPhone XS and XS Max, you

can start preordering in Friday,

September 14th, and it'll ship a

week later, September 21st.

It will start shipping in all of

these markets, a nice long list.

But if you don't see your

favorite location there, don't

worry, a week later, it'll start

shipping in all of these

locations as well.

This is-- somebody saw their

favorite country or location--

this is the fastest rollout

geographically we've ever had

for new iPhone.

That's really great.

So this holiday we have an

unbelievable lineup of iPhones.

iPhone 7 starts now at just

$449, and there are models of

iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.

iPhone 8 at $599, models of 8

and Plus.

The brand new iPhone XR starting

at $749, XS at $999, and XS Max

at $1099.

They're all running iOS 12, the

world's most advanced mobile

operating system, and we can all

upgrade to its performance and

its great features, AR, Animoji,

Memoji, Screen Time and more

next week, September 17th.

So that is our news on iPhone.

Back to Tim.

Thank you, Phil.

What a fantastic new lineup of

iPhones.

It's clearly the best lineup

we've had by far, taking the

breakthroughs of iPhone X even

further than before and making

them available to even more

people.

Now before we close this

morning, I've got a few more

updates to give you.

We've got an update to the

HomePod, our breakthrough home

speaker.

We recently added stereo pairs

and AirPlay 2, so now when you

add a second HomePod to create a

stereo pair, it creates this

incredible wide, immersive sound

stage.

You really have to hear this to

believe it.

It's really awesome.

And with AirPlay 2, HomePod

becomes the best multiroom audio

experience.

We've got some other great

features that we're bringing to

HomePod.

You'll be able to search for

your favorite songs by lyrics,

create multiple timers, make and

receive phone calls right from

your HomePod, and just like your

Apple Watch, you can ping your

iPhone or any of your Apple

devices to help find them around

your house.

It's incredibly useful at my

house.

And we couldn't be more excited

about how Siri shortcuts will

open up a world of apps for the

HomePod.

Also, we'll be shipping a new

update to TVOS with support for

Dolby At Most for Apple TV 4K.

It has stunning new 4K aerials,

and with access to a wide range

of live sports and news

programs, there are now well

over 100 video partners

available through the TV app.

Both the HomePod and the TVOS

updates will be available on

Monday, September 17th.

And then the following week,

we've got a great new update for

the Mac with MacOS Mohave, all

new Dark Mode and updates to

desktop and finder, enhanced

privacy and security in a

completely redesigned Mac App

Store.

MacOS Mohave will be available

on September 24th.

We're excited about this huge

month and all of these big

releases that we've got.

So what a great morning.

We introduced the Apple Watch

Series 4, newly designed and

reengineered to help you stay

even more active, healthy, and

connected.

It is the most capable Apple

Watch yet.

We showed you the new iPhone XS,

the most advanced smartphone in

the world, with a Super Retina

display, advanced Face ID, a

breakthrough dual camera system,

and the smartest, most powerful

chip ever in a smartphone.

And iPhone XS is not just one

phone, it's two, with the iPhone

XS Max, the biggest screen ever

in an iPhone, the biggest

battery ever in an iPhone, and

of course the biggest experience

ever in an iPhone.

And the iPhone XR with the new

Liquid Retina display, it shares

so many of the advanced features

of iPhone XS, and it is just

stunning with six beautiful new

finishes to choose from.

iPhone XR will allow us to

deliver the future of the

smartphone to even more people.

At Apple, we're always pushing

our products forward and making

technology more personal.

We hope that you love these new

products as much as we do.

We've got a hands-on area just

upstairs that's going to open in

a moment, and we hope that

you'll take time to get your

hands on them and experience

them for yourselves.

I'd like to thank everyone for

joining us this morning,

including those watching us

online, and I especially like to

thank all the people at Apple

who've made this magical day

possible.

Thank you.
