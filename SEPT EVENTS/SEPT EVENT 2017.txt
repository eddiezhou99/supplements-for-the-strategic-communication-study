[Music]

there's lots of ways to be as a person

and some people express their deep

appreciation in in different ways but

one of the ways that I believe people

express their appreciation to to the

rest of humanity is to make something

wonderful and put it out there

and you never you never meet the people

we never shake their hands

you never hear their story or tell yours

but somehow in the act of making

something with a great deal of care and

love some things transmitted there and

it's a way of expressing to the rest of

our species our deep appreciation so we

need to be true to who we are and

remember what's really important to us

that's what's gonna keep Apple Apple is

if we keep us us

[Music]

thank you

I love hearing his voice and his

inspiring message and it was only

fitting that Steve should open his

theater it is the honor of a lifetime to

be the first to welcome you to the Steve

Jobs theater Steve meant so much to me

and so much to all of us there's not a

day that goes by that we don't think

about him

memories have expecially come rushing

back as we prepared for today and this

event it's taken some time but we can

now reflect on him with joy instead of

sadness

Steve's spirit and timeless philosophy

on life will always be the DNA of Apple

his greatest gift his greatest

expression of his appreciation for

humanity would not be a singular product

but rather it would be Apple itself we

dedicate this theater to Steve because

we loved him and because he loved days

like this where he could share our

latest new products and new ideas of the

world and we do so not only to pay

tribute to Steve but to inspire the next

generation of creators and innovators

Steve was a genius and one of the many

ways that he showed that was in the his

any ability to unlock the talent of

everybody that he worked with he thought

deeply about our workplace and its

surroundings and he believed that they

should inspire talented people to do

their best work so over a decade ago he

began to work on a new campus for Apple

his vision for Apple part was to create

an incredible workplace of the future

where engineers and designers could all

be together collaborating on the next

generations of Apple product to change

the world

Steve's vision and passion live on here

at Apple Park and everywhere in Apple

today and always we honor him

we're here today to talk about some

incredible products but before we get to

that I'd like to take a moment to talk

about what's happening in Florida and

Texas southeastern United States and

across the Caribbean our our hearts go

out to all of the people whose lives

have been disrupted by hurricanes

Irma and hurricane Harvey you're in our

thoughts we send you our strength you

are in our prayers Apple is working

closely with relief and recovery efforts

through hand in hand and the American

Red Cross and in addition to Apple's

direct contributions we're making it

really simple for the entire Apple

community to donate via iTunes and the

App Store the handed hand benefit for

hurricane relief airs tonight on all of

the major broadcast networks and I

encourage you to watch it and however

you choose to give I hope that you open

your heart to this important effort

thank you

now let me tell you a little bit about

our new home will start moving in Apple

Park later this year but of course such

a large move it's really more of a

process and the first big step is the

opening today of the Steve Steve Jobs

theater it's the most state-of-the-art

purpose-built theater ever built for

events just like this one

Apple Park has been built to reflect

apples values for both technology and

the environment it connects to connect

sixth R ordinarily advanced buildings

with a rolling Park land to form an open

and inspiring environment for our teams

to create and collaborate the park

itself was converted from a sea of

asphalt into a hundred and seventy-five

acre green space with over nine thousand

trees Apple Park is designed to be

seamless with nature it's open

transparent it brings the outside in and

connects everyone to the beautiful

California landscape it's powered by a

hundred percent renewable energy thank

you

and in fact we have one of the world's

largest on-site solar installations

right here and just like everything we

make apple parkas has been designed with

extraordinary attention to detail

incredible precision and really

beautiful materials we've got a great

visitor center which will be open later

this year where we will welcome everyone

and inside the visitor center you'll

find an incredible augmented reality

experience or you can learn more about

Apple Park its design and its

innovations you'll also find a fantastic

new Apple Retail Store as you know Apple

Retail has always been about more than

selling it's about learning inspiring

and connecting with people

now our stores are also the best place

to go discover explore and experience

our new products so before we get to

some incredible products we'd like to

give you an update on retail and to do

that I'd like to invite Angela Angela

good morning thank you it's great to be

here and I love the fact that the same

team that designs Apple Park also

designs our largest retail stores around

the world but it's funny because we

actually don't call them stores anymore

we call them town squares because

they're gathering places for 500 million

people who visit us every year places

where everyone's welcome and where all

of Apple comes together but what really

brings it all to life is Tim said are

our incredible teams we've always said

that our people are our soul and they're

Apple's greatest differentiator because

they bring personal connection to

communities all over the world they

humanize technology but along with our

amazing teams our commitment to design

also sets us apart

to make things simple beautiful and

that's why we think of Apple retail as

Apple's largest products and like all of

our products we've designed new features

to take the customer experience even

further in our largest cities where we

can we create a Plaza a space open to

everyone come in and relax meet up with

friends or just listen to a local artist

on the weekends inside we've designed a

forum a place for customers to come and

create collaborate or just connect again

with one another for local entrepreneurs

and app developers we have a quieter

space in the larger stores called a

boardroom where they can learn more from

our teams or again share with each other

em'ly genius growth a redesigned more

relaxed service service experience now

in the heart of our largest stores and

lastly The Avenues kind of like shop

windows around a town square

they're carefully curated and they

change seasonally to always feature our

newest products and services and this

summer to turn on these new features

we've launched today at Apple our

in-store experience designed to inspire

customers to go even further with their

passions

we started with things that are Cort

Apple's DNA things people most use their

devices for and they trust us to teach

them like photography music gaming and

app development we've created new

programs like photo walks where

customers can perfect their photography

skills with features like portrait mode

and memories and we do all of this in a

really fun social way by taking me out

to the neighborhood to explore with each

other or Swift playgrounds where the

next generation app developers can begin

to learn the basics of coding and one of

my personal favorites teachers Tuesday's

where our teams help local educators

stay updated on the newest technologies

and apps in some of our larger stores

sessions are led by local artists like

this music lab called the art of beat

making with RZA

and the Rowley team in Brooklyn these

sessions in all stores are led by our

creative team and a new position we call

a creative pro so the creative pro is

now the liberal arts as the genius has

always been to technology and I would

love to show a quick video to show you

how today at Apple is coming to life

we're learning about photography you

have tons of good ideas in your head so

it was like oh I like that I'm gonna

explore that some more

when you do something for the first time

you have to be completely fearless

he just started you've just started but

the feedback has been fantastic

customers are telling us they love the

role that Apple Retail is playing in

their community so what's next well

we're gonna continue to open Apple town

squares in the top cities around the

world we're going to invest in online

and we're also going to continue to

reinvest in our 400 classic locations

including Apple 5th Avenue in New York

City where we're opening up the plaza to

allow natural sunlight to come in into a

greatly expanded space below and you can

see the glass you will return when

reopened late next year and in Paris

we're restoring an entire historic

building on the iconic seans Alizee

we're turning a five-story atrium into

our largest forum early next year we're

transforming a theater beneath Piazza

Liberty into a modern day town square

for Milan

just imagine movie night there next

summer and we've recently announced an

ambitious project to restore Carnegie

Library in the heart of our nation's

capital we can't think of a better place

for today at Apple programs than a

building originally created for the city

to access knowledge and unlock their

potential

and I'm thrilled to personally announce

the opening of our newest flagship store

in the heart of the Midwest Apple

Michigan Avenue in Chicago on October

20th

our team has designed a spectacular

pavilion but seamlessly connects the

plaza to the promenade as a part of the

city's plan to transform the Chicago

riverfront so that's a brief highlight

just a couple of things we've been

working on and as Tim said Apple's

retail purpose has always been to enrich

lives so a huge thank you to the 65,000

Apple retail employees around the world

whose passion energy and commitment in

serving all of us every day and ensuring

all of Apple comes together it's

brilliant thank you thanks Angela I am

really excited I'm really excited about

all the incredible things going on in

retail but I am especially proud of our

unbelievable retail team it's the best

place to go experience our new products

and so let's get going on telling you

about what we're going to launch today

beginning with Apple watch

Apple watch was designed to help people

stay active motivated and connected so

that they could live a better day and

I'm happy to tell you that more people

are doing that than ever before since

the launch of the series - the Apple

watch has experienced phenomenal growth

in fact last quarter Apple watch grew

over 50 percent compared to the previous

year this is incredible

last year we told you that the Apple

watch had already become the number two

watch in the world today I'm thrilled to

tell you the Apple watch is now the

number one watch in the world

but what's most rewarding to us is how

much our users love it art we have an

industry-leading customer satisfaction

rate of 97% this is Lola people write to

us all the time and tell us how the

Apple watch is helping them lead a

healthier life these stories are

unbelievable and we prepared a video so

that you could hear directly from them

what they're telling us

I'd love to play it for you kitty the

Apple pretty visible dear tim tooten the

affable hello mr. cook my abuse with

keyboard cousin I see but I just wanted

to put it out there I live in

Massachusetts I'm a country boy from

small town Mississippi I'm a two-time

Olympian it was home by a dinner Osheaga

Mountain poncho I'm the father of a

nine-year-old

I am a ninety nine year old every day

for the last two-and-a-half years I have

born this tiny computer on my wrist this

is the first time I've worn a watch

since my bar mitzvah I was a scrawny

sports hitting kid who never really

liked being active I was coming back

from a knee surgery while I was never

fed

I was the proud owner of the dad but I'm

feeling to a deep depression and

weighing 250

because they reduce the critics activity

now I get up at 5 a.m. if it's 5 minutes

to midnight I'll do push-ups in my

bedroom I'll take the dog out for a

really quick walk around the block I

walk around the house and my family

thinks I'm a little crazy I do to flee

obliged mamatha voice reminds me to

stand up every hour Sybil would just no

real solution since today I ran my first

partner race in December during a full

marathon in February

I got acoustic on mocospace Amano

Moochie Busey size

today I've watched that walkable ship

gala war and order bunju initiative dear

mr. cook our daughter was recently

diagnosed with type 1 diabetes a car

rolled over three times and my phone

landed far out of my reach

once I collected my thoughts I

remembered my Apple watch had the SOS

feature after being rushed to the

emergency room

I was diagnosed with a condition that

was causing my liver kidneys hearts to

start shutting down the integration of

her glucose monitor with the Apple watch

lets us make sure her blood sugars don't

go to dangerously low levels for six

minutes they hung there in my car

talking to a dispatcher until help

arrived had I not been wearing my Apple

watch I never would have sought medical

attention which in turn saved my life

sincerely Paul thank you so much for

creating something that does not make me

feel oh thanks for listening

avi sincerely Stewart oh ha ha all the

best

Tara clearly Oh Jill Casey blue got that

with you me three Oh God

those stories are so moving and there's

really no words to describe what it

feels like to receive these notes I'd

like to thank everybody in the video for

sharing their personal experience with

all of us we have some great news about

the future of Apple watch and to share

it with you I'd like to invite Jeff fobb

Jeff

[Applause]

thanks down those stories are really

great and it's it's really inspiring to

us that so many people are getting

healthier with Apple watch with watch OS

4 they're gonna be able to do even more

we're adding smart activity coaching

which is gonna help more people close

more rings more often a completely

redesigned workout app with high

intensity interval training new features

for swimmers like Auto sets and gym kick

an industry-first

it's really simple you just tap your

watch on a machine get going and all

your metrics are in sync

one of the things that enables these

fitness features is the apple heart rate

sensor and it's been at the core of

Apple watch since the very beginning and

today it's the most used heart rate

monitor in the world and we want to use

it to help even more people so we're

doing three things first we're making

enhancements to the heart rate app to

give you more information now

you'll see your heart rate right on the

watch face so you can keep an eye on it

with just a raise of the wrist and when

you launch the heart rate app you'll see

new measurements like resting heart rate

Apple watch calculates this daily by

correlating background heart rate

readings with accelerometer data and

recovery heart rate which tells you how

quickly your heart rate drops after

workout a lower resting heart rate and a

quicker recovery rate can be Sons of

improved fitness and now you can keep a

better picture of your heart rate you'll

have a better picture throughout the day

the second thing we were doing is

inspired by many of the letters we

received from customers who notice an

unusually high heart rate when they

wouldn't expect one so Apple watch has

been helpful for them but we realize

most people won't notice so we're adding

a feature and now Apple watch will

notify you when it detects an elevated

heart rate you and you don't appear to

be active

and the third thing we're doing is

focused on heart rhythm our regular

heart rhythm has a familiar pattern but

when your heart beats irregularly is

called an arrhythmia it doesn't mean

it's beating too fast or too slow it

just means it's beating out of its

normal rhythm and that can cause

problems the most common form of serious

arrhythmia is called atrial fibrillation

or afib and it affects tens of millions

of people and is a leading cause of

stroke but the challenge is many people

with afib don't feel symptoms so it

often goes undiagnosed we've been

looking at this for a couple of years

and we think Apple watch can help in our

initial studies Apple watch has been

effective at surfacing irregular rhythms

so we're expanding that work and today

we're announcing the Apple heart study

it will use data from Apple watch and it

will analyze arrhythmias including afib

and notify users this study is being

conducted in partnership with Stanford

medicine and we're working closely with

the FDA and they've been great to work

with so later this year the first phase

of the Apple heart study will be

available in the US on the App Store

those are the updates focused on fitness

and health and they join the other great

features of watch OS 4 we have a

completely redesigned music experience

an intelligent Siri face fun new

characters from Toy Story and more so

that's watch OS 4 it will be available

to all Apple watch customers on

September 19

and now I'd like to introduce the next

generation of Apple watch

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

introducing Apple watch Series three and

it has cellular built-in now you have

the freedom to go anywhere with just

your Apple watch this this has been our

vision from the very beginning and we

believe built-in Cellular makes series

three the ultimate expression of Apple

watch now you can go for a run with just

your watch and still be connected you

can leave your phone when you go to the

beach or just run a quick errand and

it's really nice to know you can be

reached if needed while staying in the

moment you can receive an important call

with just your watch and and the number

is the same number as your iPhone you

don't have to manage a separate number

the apps you rely on like messages just

work in series at your beck and call

anytime anywhere

you can use maps and get directions and

the location for PHY my friend

automatically switches to your watch

when you're away from your phone and

third-party apps like WeChat work over

cellular as well and coming next month

cellular is going to change the way we

listen to music because with Apple watch

series 3 and Apple music you can stream

40 million songs on your wrist

you'll have access to all your favorite

music you can listen to beats one live

or any Apple radio music station you can

even ask Siri to find you the perfect

track now the best device for staying

motive for staying active has all the

music you need to stay motivated what to

enable these features on Apple watch we

have packed Series three with the most

advanced technologies ever in a watch

inside is a new dual-core processor

delivering up to 70% more more

performance it's really really fast Siri

is quicker than ever and thanks to the

new processor for the first time on

Apple watch Siri can talk it's 64

degrees right now in South Lake Tahoe

it's actually it's really convenient to

not have to look at the screen when you

ask it a question for Bluetooth and

Wi-Fi connectivity we developed a custom

wireless chip we call w2 there's nothing

else like it it delivers up to 85%

faster Wi-Fi while being 50% more power

power efficient for both Bluetooth and

Wi-Fi and we've added a barometric

altimeter so now you get flights of

stairs climbed and elevation gains after

a workout we're also releasing an app

for developers it's going to be great

for skiing and snowboarding acts of

course got a snowboarder out there

of course the biggest challenge of all

was adding cellular you see our little

watch is already packed and you have to

add antennas radios power amplifiers a

SIM card and if you don't do it right it

gets so big it looks like a house arrest

bracelet and you're not going to want to

wear it so our engineers have been hard

at work and they've come up with some

really creative solutions for example

rather than add an antenna the display

itself is the multi frequency antenna

for both LTE and UMTS and of course you

have to have a SIM card but even a nano

SIM would be way too big so instead we

integrated an electronic SIM and it's a

fraction of the size so here's where we

ended up even with all these new

features faster dual-core processor w2

altimeter all the stuff you've got to

put in for cellular the case for series

3 is the same size as series 2

the only difference is we extended the

back crystal amir 0.25 millimeters

that's as thin as two sheets of paper

it's it's really magical to make a

stand-alone call on a device this small

and I'd like to do that for you right

now I'm gonna switch watches so you guys

can see what's going on this watch is

connected over the AT&T cellular network

this is our new Explorer face and I'm

going to tap on the the phone app and

I'm gonna call Deidre who's a colleague

on the watch team hi hi Deidre hey I'm

calling you from the new Steve Jobs

theater how are you doing oh yeah sure

sure you are why don't we pull in some

video and show everybody where you are

this is gonna marry but you know me I'm

a team player yeah that's you Deidre

give give give

well it looks beautiful out there it is

amazing well so so far so far so good

date a I should probably cut it off

before something goes awry but be safe

out there and thanks for doing this yeah

okay okay that sounds great teacher

come on I'm gonna go rogue for a minute

I you know you got you guys get it but

sometimes people take technology for

granted and just just for perspective I

might in fact I'm actually double Mike

in just the right location so you can

hear me DJ's out in the middle of a

windy lake and the only microphone on

Deidre is the little tiny one on the

Apple watch it's a foot or two away from

her mouth she's paddling and the signals

being sent over cellular coming in and

that's just darn close to magic

series three comes in a wide variety of

cases in bands we have a beautiful new

gold aluminum finish along with silver

and Space Gray and we're excited to

introduce a new band we call the sport

loop it's designed for an active

lifestyle and it's light stretchy and

breathable for Apple watch Nike plus we

have exclusive new colors and they're

releasing a new version of their Nike

Plus run club app with great new

features like in run audio coaching and

we have some wonderful colors across all

of our bands that you just have to see

in person we have a great partnership

with Hermes and the tradition continues

this year with some new watch face

styles some beautiful new bands like the

one on the left that's inspired by the

classic Hermes driving glove and last

year we introduced a white ceramic watch

this year we're adding a ceramic watch

in a gorgeous gray finish

all of these watches were built with a

great deal of care as well as a concern

for the environment and they're free of

these harmful materials so that's Apple

watch series three cellular GPS swim

proves 70% faster dual-core processor

barometric altimeter all the features of

watch OS 4 and it still has all day

battery life up to 18 hours across a mix

of LTE Bluetooth and Wi-Fi we have two

versions of series three there's one

with cellular at 399 and a version

without cellular that has all the other

great features at just 329 and we're

going to keep series 1 in the line at a

new starting price of 249

[Applause]

series 3 cellular will be available in

these nine countries with these 14

carriers at launch and six more coming

later in the year and we've worked with

each of these carriers and they're each

off have a special introductory offer

for series 3 so it's going to be great

and we we are offering the the series 3

without cellular in these 26 countries

at launch orders will begin September

15th and availability will be September

22nd that's the update on Apple watch

and now back to Tim

Apple watch Apple watch is the ultimate

device were healthy in life in the

series 3 takes that to a whole new level

now Jeff showed you some very cool

things you can do with the cellular

function in a series three and one of

those is to stream 40 million songs

right on your wrist

we've made a great ad showing just that

I'd love to play it for you

[Music]

you

[Music]

you

[Music]

this is a big moment for Apple watch and

we think you are going to love it

next up I'd like to turn your attention

to Apple TV Apple TV has changed the way

we experience television simplifying the

way that we discover and enjoy movies TV

shows sports news games absence and so

much more

in fact we've just been awarded our

second Emmy for Apple TV thank you

the semi was in recognition for how Siri

makes it so easy to search discover and

interact with your TV content we're

really really proud of the efforts we've

made to improve the TV experience now

throughout the history of TV there's

been a few key inflection points that

have changed the way we experience

television it of course all began with

black-and-white and it was first

transformed with the introduction of

color it took a huge step forward with

the advent of HD each stage brought with

it a more true to life experience a more

immersive experience now we're at the

next major inflection point one that has

the most stunning visuals ever that are

ideal for the large TV screens that are

coming into our living rooms

this will bring cinematic quality to

virtually everything that you watch

that's why I am so excited to introduce

Apple TV 4k

at the heart of Apple TV 4k are two key

technologies that are driving this next

evolution of the TV experience and to

tell you all about them I'd like to

invite Eddie to the stage Eddie

thank you Tim it is really great to be

here tonight Apple TV 4k is incredible

and it starts with two big advancements

in picture quality first is 4k let me

show you this is an image in 4k it's got

incredible detail that's possible

because 4k has four times the number of

pixels as HD but resolution isn't

everything there's an even bigger

advancement that's more important and

it's called high dynamic range or HDR

while 4k is about the number of pixels

HDR is about better pixels let me show

you here's that same 4k image and here

it is an HDR look at the color the

details Apple TV can do this because it

supports the industry standard HDR 10 as

well as Dolby vision the best HDR

experience now Apple TV 4k with HDR

delivers the highest picture quality

ever and to show you we've installed a

state-of-the-art Dolby 4k HDR cinema

projector in the theater so let's dim

the lights and let me show you the new

Apple TV now we remastered our screen

savers our customers love these to take

full advantage of 4k HDR

here we are in Dubai and even at night

you can see incredible details in the

buildings and the cars on the road now

here's a city shot that really shows off

the crispness and sharpness that's

possible in the new Apple TV and we've

redone the whole Apple TV UI in 4k the

Texas sharper the images are brighter

and more vibrant but let's take a look

at a 4k HDR clip this is from the new

spider-man movie coming to iTunes later

this month

yoga's high-tech stuff makes it too easy

stop guys forget your PIN number wow

you're the Avengers what are you guys

doing here Hulk finally meet you guys

wait be more handsome in person Oh Iron

Man what are you doing here

now that that was great and that was all

playing on the new Apple TV 4k now at

the heart of the Apple TV we've got the

powerful a 10x fusion chip this is the

same chip that's in our iPad pro and the

new Apple TV isn't just slightly faster

it's remarkably faster CPU performance

is more than twice as fast as the

current Apple TV and graphics are more

than four times faster and of course it

runs the latest version of TV OS the

best operating system for the living

room now to experience 4k with HDR you

also need great content and we've been

working with the large Hollywood studios

to bring all of their 4k and HDR movie

titles to iTunes so now you'll have the

biggest releases in the best picture

quality all on iTunes all available for

the same price as HD and if you've

bought one of those movies in HD from

iTunes we're gonna automatically upgrade

them to 4k HD are at no additional

charge

now in addition to iTunes we've been

working with leading streaming providers

like Netflix to bring their 4k HDR

titles to Apple TV and later this year

Amazon Prime video with all of their 4k

HDR titles and originals as well now

last year we introduced the Apple TV app

an easy way to watch your favorite

movies and TV shows in a single place

it's been available in the US and today

I'm happy to announce that we're

bringing it to seven additional

countries Canada and Australia later

this month and the rest by the end of

the year now for each country it's

really important that we have the

content that those customers know and

love and that's why we're adding all of

these local services to Apple TV now

later this year Apple TV will do even

more because we're bringing live sports

so you'll never miss a game if you're a

huge sports fan like I am you're really

going to love this feature if your

favorite team is playing on ESPN it'll

automatically appear right first in the

up next list you'll even get

notifications when a games about to

start

or if there's a close game so you can

start watching instantly and if you

scroll up you'll see even more games and

in addition we're bringing live news to

the TV app now let's take a look at

those games as you can see we show you

the score and the time remaining to help

you decide which game to watch

and if you're one of these people that

doesn't like to know the score you can

turn the feature off now we also have a

dedicated sports tab where you can see

every live and upcoming game and as the

seasons change so will the sports tab

always showing what's you what's best

for you as forts in the TV app is a real

game-changer for sports fans and of

course the new TV app is available on

your iPhone and iPad as well if you own

an iPad or iPhone there's no better

choice than Apple TV you can now share

your photos on the big screen including

live photo effects 4k video memory

you can play from the over 40 million

songs and Apple music including the

music that your friends are listening to

and because Apple TV is always home you

get anywhere anytime access to all of

your home kit accessories and of course

you've got access to choose from the

thousands of games and apps on the App

Store and with the 8nx fusion ship

there's so much more that Apple TV can

do and to see what's possible we'd love

to show you a new game from that game

company they're known for making

artistic and critically acclaimed games

as a matter of fact their first game

called flower was chosen as the first

video game ever to be in the permanent

collection in the Smithsonian which is

very very cool so with that I would love

to welcome their CEO Jenova Chen

at that game company we treat games as

an art form

today many of us play games alone but we

believe games is a medium that can bring

people together and that's exactly what

we are going to do with our new game sky

together with me as my colleague Mike

and like why don't we take off sky is a

romantic social adventure game well you

fly above the clouds to explore the

wonders of a mysterious world the game

is designed to be adaptable to the most

casual players the control is simple and

intuitive everything can be done with

one finger on the Siri remote oh hey

that's Mike's friend Jeff and he's

asking us to follow him let's see what

he has discovered compassion and

generosity are key to unveil hidden

areas of the world as well as growing

your character so by lighting all the

candles Jeff and Mike was able to summer

in the spirit and he's about to teach

Mike the knowledge of how to sever a

magical creature

in sky we really take advantage of the

powerful new hardware with Matt OH - an

Apple TV's a 10x fusion chip we were

able to run the game smoothly even with

these detailed clouds intelligent

creatures and up to eight players from

anywhere around the world and let's see

if we can draft off one of these

creatures

we don't have time to show you

everything so we're gonna skip forward

to the dark tempo head light and dark

are important themes of the game in sky

you play as the children of light and

your goal is to bring that light to

where it is needed the most

where's the light Mike was able to free

all the butterflies and together they

can move on to the next part of the

adventure with a live orchestral

soundtrack and a cinematic experiences

you can expect to be immersed in an ever

expanding world so join hands with your

loved ones and play sky exclusively on a

Poe TV I pad and iPhone this winter

thank you thanks Jennifer we can't wait

for you to get your hands on sky we're

so excited about the new Apple TV 4k

it's got powerful hardware that delivers

stunning 4k HDR video live sports along

with live news TV shows and and and

movies all in the TV app and the perfect

big-screen companion for your iPhone or

iPad the new Apple TV 4k starts at $179

it joins the existing one you can order

it starting on September 15th and it

ships just a week later that is the new

Apple TV 4k thank you and I'd like to

turn it back to ten

I can't wait for you to experience the

beauty and the magic of the cinema right

in your living room with the Apple TV 4k

next up iPhone

Apple has always believed that

technology infused with humanity could

improve people's lives and change the

world no other device in our lifetimes

have had the impact on the world that

the iPhone has nothing else has become

so essential or put so much power into

so many people's hands than iPhone it's

truly amazing how much iPhone impacts

the world each and every day our

intention with iPhone has always been

able to been to create something so

powerful so immersive and so magical

that the hardware virtually disappears

over the last 10 years we've reimagined

or invented numerous technologies to

create just that experience the first

iPhone forever changed how we interact

with technology by introducing

multi-touch for the first time you were

actually touching the software instead

of buttons it was magical the app store

changed the way we work play learn

communicate spawning new companies and

new industries along the way we took the

viewing experience to places literally

never seen before with technologies like

the Retina display we change the way

people communicate with features like

iMessage and FaceTime that allowed us

all to connect in more meaningful ways

and with Siri we used artificial

intelligence to make our voices more

powerful iPhone even revolutionized

security and privacy with touch ID and

our wallets with Apple pay and of course

iPhone put amazing easy-to-use cameras

into our hands becoming the most popular

way to capture the images of our lives

over the past decade we pushed forward

with innovation after innovation after

innovation bringing us to this moment

when now we can create devices that are

far more intelligent far more capable

far more personal than ever before

we have huge iPhone news for you today

and it gets started right now

[Applause]

[Music]

iPhone 8 iphone 8 this is a huge step

forward for iPhone and to tell you all

about it I'd like to invite Phil to the

stage Phil a good morning everyone I am

so excited to tell you all about the new

iPhone 8 and the new iPhone 8 plus these

are a new generation of iPhone and they

improve on everything we love about

iPhone the design is all new it has

glass in both the front in the back the

aluminum band beautifully matches the

finish of each iPhone a it comes in

silver Space Gray and a beautiful new

gold finish it's made from an aerospace

grade 7000 series custom aluminum alloy

the glass has a seven-layer color

process making sure there's a beautiful

precise hue and the glass is further

reinforced by an internal laser welded

steel and copper structure

we're so excited because this glass is

the most durable ever in a smartphone

iPhone 8 an A+ is also microscopically

sealed for water and dust resistance and

they have a new retina HD display in

each model there's a 4.7 inch Retina

display in iphone 8 and a 5.5 inch an

iPhone 8 plus now Apple Retina displays

are renowned for their incredible color

accuracy and they have great wide cinema

quality color gamut we've built in our

3d touch technology into the display and

for the first time an iPhone display it

is our true tone technology now with

true tone it adapts the color

temperature and intensity to the ambient

light around us along with the displays

iPhone 8 and 8 plus have new stereo

speakers as well the 25% louder

the speaker's an iPhone 7 and they have

a deeper base to and this is pretty

incredible

inside iPhone 8 mate plus is a brand new

chip and this is a breakthrough

performance in a mobile device we call

it a 11 Bionic this is the most powerful

and smartest chip ever in a smartphone

it's a 64-bit design 4.3 billion

transistors six core we're gonna geek

out here for a bit cuz it is so awesome

it has two high-performance course there

25% faster than the high performance

course and the previous industry-leading

810 chip is for high efficiency cords

through up to 70% faster than the ones

in the a-10 chip they're managed by our

second generation performance controller

that now can use all six cores at once

it can deliver up to 70 percent

improvement in multi-threaded workloads

and they have our first ever Apple

design graphics processing unit or GPU

this is a three core design it's 30%

faster than the graphics in the previous

a 10 and the GPU is designed to

accelerate 3d apps and games especially

those that use our new metal 2 framework

and the GPU also is incredible for

machine learning apps and those kind of

tasks get a big speed up if they use our

our core machine learning framework -

there's more to it the 11 by iana

concludes our first new generation image

signal processor or isp so you know this

is used in photography the delivers

faster autofocus in low-light

it has new pixel processing for

sharpness and texture and for the first

time to help reduce noise it has

Hardware enabled multiband noise

reduction all this helps to improve

performance and helps us take better

pictures perhaps the most beloved

feature of every new generation of

iPhone is the cameras and people love

taking photos and customers sent us

their photos for our shot on iphone

campaign like this one this was sent

from Jeremy Perez Cruz

with an iPhone 7 plus and people gonna

love taking pictures with the iPhone 8

camera it is an all-new 12 megapixel

sensor it's larger and faster it

provides 83 percent more light and it

provides more it's more power efficient

at the same time it is deeper pixels and

a new color filter so this adds up to

having better color saturation a wider

dynamic range of color and lower noise

in your photos and videos by phone 8

plus has two new sensors in its dual

camera the wide-angle camera has an F

1.8 aperture and optical image

stabilization the telephoto camera has F

2.8 aperture so as always we want to

show you the kind of photos you can take

off of our new cameras now these are

photos we're going to show that have not

been retouched in any way they're

straight off the iPhone 8 and 8 plus so

here's the first one this is absolutely

beautiful

now that's not the Golden Gate Bridge

this is taken in Portugal it shows the

beauty of wide color gamut there's great

dynamic range sharpness and incredibly

low noise just look at that blue sky

here's another example

it shows incredible Y quality colour

again just look at the skin tones and

the detail and the hair in the eyes if

you look closely in her eyes you can

actually see the photographer reflected

there holding an iPhone to take the

picture here's a great example of the

amazing textures in depth and

photography you can really feel the

fabric and you can see details in their

face behind the fabric here's a great

example of low-light photography texture

detail and very subtle colors in this

darker environment last year we

introduced portrait mode iPhone 8 takes

fantastic portrait modes and people flip

over taking these photos and now with

the iPhone 8 plus you're gonna get

sharper details more uses in low-light

and even a more natural bokeh in the

background of the photos so this is a

big hit we had a surprise new feature

last year of portrait mode we brought it

out in beta and it just got better and

better over time and customers send us

photos they love this so we challenged

the engineering team to do that again to

make it easy for all of us to take

advantage of it

advanced photographic technique and

they're doing it and it has to do with

lighting and if you've ever had a

professional portrait taken you know

that Pro photographers used advanced

equipment and have a great understanding

advanced techniques to literally sculpt

the light on your face to create the

perfect mood for a portrait photograph

well our team is making this possible

for all of us using the new dual cameras

and the a 11 Bionic chip and the iPhone

8 plus the team has come up with a new

feature called portrait lighting this is

beta but it will ship with the iPhone 8

plus and here's how it works

when you compose a photo in the camera

app using the portrait mode the dual

cameras in the isp sense the scene they

create a depth map they separate the

subject from the background and then you

see machine learning it creates facial

landmarks and actually changes the

lighting of the contours over your face

that happens while you're composing the

shot

it's super easy to use right when you're

in the camera app you use portrait mode

and there's a new menu to select the

lighting effect you want to use you just

swipe to pick a different effect for

whatever you want to shoot now these

aren't filters this is real-time

analysis of the light on your subjects

face in fact you can go in later after

you shot a portrait mode photo into the

Photos app and change the lighting

effect to select which one you want to

use on your photograph

the team has done an unbelievable job on

this and so here's an example of a photo

that's taken not touched in any way this

is portrait mode using portrait lighting

it's actually using the setting and

portrait lighting for stage light so it

drops away the background to make this

stunning dramatic photograph it's

absolutely beautiful

so iPhone 8 and 8 plus are incredible

for taking pictures they're also amazing

for video as well in fact iPhone 8 has

the highest quality video capture ever

in a smartphone along with the isp we

have an apple design video encoder this

enables faster frame rates and higher

quality video it does real-time image

and motion analysis to predict changes

in the content and optimize the video

encoding algorithms so while you're

shooting video let's say for K 60 frames

a second the iPhone 8 divides each frame

into individual tiles two million of

them and we analyze the two million

tiles every second looking for details

like texture and edges to predict

whether that tile has grass sky water or

movement in it so let's say you're

shooting 4k 60 frame rate video you can

look like this it's beautifully

optimized for quality and for

compression level and this video was

shot on an iPhone in 4k it's amazing and

if you're one of the many people who

love shooting slow-mo videos that's

gotten a lot better too now you can

shoot a 1080p HD 240 frames a second

that's double the frame rate of previous

absolutely beautiful so now iPhone 8 is

incredible for shooting photos it's

incredible for video there's a third

category of use of the camera that's

gonna become increasingly important in

our mobile devices and that's augmented

reality this is an incredible area for

us to advance in in our teams have

worked together hardware and software to

make iPhone the first camera the first

iPhone really created for augmented

reality in the first smartphone designed

for it as well we custom tune each

iPhone for augmented reality

the cameras are actually individually

calibrated in the factory and that makes

a huge difference in the performance for

AR there are new gyroscopes new

accelerometers and a are kits software

is tightly tuned to all this hardware to

deliver the best experience for motion

tracking an AR greatly benefits in the

new a 11 Bionic chip the CPU handles

world tracking the new Apple GPU renders

amorous mersive graphics at up to 60

frames a second the new ISP does

real-time lighting estimation and this

stuff is amazing that it happens on a

device in the palm of our hands so I

want to show you some of the work that

developers are starting to do with AR

apps on iPhone 8 so here's one example

it's a game Warhammer 40k free blade

from pixel toys you can now use their

photo mode to bring the free blade night

into the real world and play it right

where your friends are standing around

you here's another from Major League

Baseball's advanced media team they're

enhancing the at bat app with a our kit

so that when you're at the game you can

hold up your iPhone and see real-time

player information and stats on top of

the game you're watching and here's sky

guide from v STAR Labs you can use AR

kit with this app to actually

superimpose the map on top of the sky as

you're looking at it around you this

isn't some generic sky this is the sky

around you

so now we want to show you a exciting AR

app right here live on stage playing on

an iPhone 8 it's from Directive games

this is a new startup based in Shanghai

it's founded by developers who have

worked in some of the biggest franchises

in gaming

so please welcome at Lamar CEO and

co-founder of Directive games at leak

earlier the summer with the introduction

of AR kit

Apple changed gaming forever what we're

about to show you is one of the world's

first competitive multiplayer games

designed to be played entirely in

augmented reality this is the machines

in the game players battle their friends

in real time either online or around the

table in the same room my friend and

co-founder Andrea is preparing a match

for us where we play the rebels against

the dominators

what's really cool is with a or kit the

metal two on the new iPhone we are able

to experience games in an entirely new

way these players are able to view the

game from any angle our content has to

be incredibly detailed with the power of

the new iPhone an unreal support for

metal 2 we are able to render the entire

level on screen and amazing 1.2 million

polygons while also allowing you to move

in close to really appreciate the high

visual fidelity and just look at those

4k textures

it's gorgeous now shall we go into the

game

AR allows us to use our position in the

real world the game a tactical advantage

just look how antha is moving towards

this cave lining up his targets this is

something that would have been hard to

do with tension - it's like you're not

just controlling the game you're in the

game another awesome addition to the

experience is spatial audio if you go

close to the action the sound increases

and if a solid object gets between you

and the action the sound is occluded

perfect now with the stereo speakers on

the new iPhone this is truly amazing it

looks like we're getting hit pretty hard

yes deploy shield to protect our heroes

now let's rain fire on our enemies move

closer to their base and get ready for

the fatal blow with our super weapon

oh the dropship is there can you take it

out at the same time

what you just saw is an amazing

evolution in how games are played and

experienced thanks to the combination of

air kit and metal - on the brand new

iphone we can't wait for you to play it

look for the machines on the App Store

this month exclusively on iOS

Thank You Atlee now let's talk about

Wireless we once said that the future is

Wireless and boy will be right that's

becoming more true than ever before with

iPhone 8 it supports LTE advanced for

fast networking connections Bluetooth

5.0 for the latest accessories

of course it supports our great beloved

air pods and the beats X headphones that

use our w1 chip and the new Beats Studio

threes as well and now with iPhone 8

with its glass back we're enabling the

freedom of wireless charging I mean this

is a simple thing we do this everyday we

use our phones in the day and we charge

them at night often on a charger by our

bed stand in our homes or in our hotels

and words can't describe just how much

nicer it is to just put it down and pick

it up whenever you want to charge

without ever having to plug in a cable

again you want to do this by your

bedside gonna want to do this in a cafe

or restaurant as they start to support

wireless charging I want to do it in an

airport so you can top up your charge

before you get on the next flight and

perhaps the best use case of all in your

car you can get into your car wirelessly

connect and start using carplay put your

iPhone on the center console and it's

charging all without ever having to plug

in a cable again

what makes this possible is we're

building into iPhone 8 and 8 plus

wireless charging with Qi that she is

the leading openness wireless charging

standard and we hope to help Qi by

increasing adoption of it in creating

new use cases for it many restaurants

shops airports cars have started to

build in support for Qi wireless

charging and they'll work with iPhone a

many companies are offering Qi chargers

and those that are Qi certified should

all work with iPhone 8 and we've worked

with some developers who are creating Qi

charges and we're gonna offer them in

our stores and online for our iPhone 8

customers

like this one from Mophie and this one

from Belkin

so that's iPhone 8 it's a new generation

of iPhone it improves on everything we

love about iPhone it is packed with

innovative technologies from the glass

and aluminum design to the retina HD

displays the new a11 Bionic chip it's

there designed for AR apps like no phone

has been before a new single and dual

cameras their support for the brand new

photo lighting effects in portrait mode

and wireless charging now iPhone 7 came

in these three configurations starting

at 32 gigabytes will really happen to

your iPhone 8 it's gonna start with

twice the capacity at 64 gigabytes and

have a second one at 256 gigabytes and

the price will be six hundred and ninety

nine dollars iPhone 8 plus will have the

same two configurations 64 gigabytes and

256 gigabytes and it will be priced

starting at $799 well will be able to

pre-order them starting this Friday on

September 15th and to be available a

week later on September 22nd and we can

all upgrade to iOS 11 starting on

September 19th so that is iPhone 8 I

like to turn it back to Tim

iPhone 8 a new generation of iPhone and

a huge step forward but we're not

stopping there we do have one more thing

we have great respect for these words

and we don't use them lightly our teams

have been hard at work for years on

something that is important to all of us

the future of the smartphone the first

iPhone revolutionized a decade of

technology and changed the world in the

process now 10 years later it is only

fitting that we are here in this place

on this day to reveal a product that

will set the path for technology for the

next decade

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Music]

this is iPhone 10 it is the biggest leap

forward since the original iPhone and to

tell you all about it I'd like to invite

Phil back up Phil thank you Tim I think

you'd imagine there are a lot of people

at Apple that didn't get much sleep last

night preparing for this is this this is

so exciting and it is all scream it is

beautiful to look at it is incredible to

hold the display fits edge to edge top

to bottom it goes into each corner where

it follows the tight curve of the design

it has glass on both the front in the

back using the same super-strong formula

as iPhone 8 the beam is made from a

surgical grade stainless steel that's

both durable and polishes to a beautiful

finish and look how the glass and the

stainless steel fit form a continuous

surface from front to back there has

never been anything like it it's

engineered to be water and dust

resistant at a microscopic level comes

in two beautiful finishes space grey and

silver each has an incredible depth in a

pearl essence to the color in the glass

iPhone 10 has an all-new display it's

called the super Retina display

the love of quality and responsiveness

and efficiency is really quite a

breakthrough in mobile displays to start

with the super Retina Display is 5.8

inches on the diagonal

it's got 24 36 by 1125 resolution that's

over 2.7 million pixels it is 458 pixels

per inch now this is the highest

resolution and pixel density ever in an

iPhone and it's remarkable how this

larger display can be packed into a

phone that fits so comfortably in our

hands the super Retina display uses OLED

technology this is the first OLED

display great enough to be in an iPhone

traditional OLED displays have had great

benefits like high contrast and

resolution and no backlight means you

can make them thinner but they came with

trade-offs and brightness and rich

colors and color accuracy at least

compared to our Retina displays but the

super Retina display overcomes all of

these deficiencies and lives up to all

that we expect from an iPhone display in

addition the new super Retina display

supports HDR in both the Dolby vision

and HDR 10 formats it has an incredible

a million to 1 contrast ratio it has the

best colour accuracy it integrates our

unique 3d touch technology right into

the display and like iPhone 8 includes

true tone now all this innovative super

Retina display technology is great but

it's the point of it that matters and

the point of it is to enable an entirely

new experience that's more fluid more

intuitive so let's start with the

simplest thing how do you wake up your

iPhone 10 well certainly you can raise

to wake just like before but now you can

also just tap on the screen and it wakes

up now with the display going edge to

edge and top to bottom there's no more

home button now this is an important

part in a big step forward in the iPhone

user experience something would use

hundreds of times a day for so

any tasks is an opportunity to rethink

how iPhone should work and how we can

make it better so now when you want to

go to the home screen you simply swipe

up from the bottom and you go home it's

that simple it's that easy it's

incredibly smooth and once you do it for

the first time you'll know there's never

been a better way and it works the same

way across the system if you're running

an app like Mayo and you want to go home

what do you do you simply swipe up from

the bottom and you go home it's that

easy and that intuitive it's so much

nicer now the same fluid gesture also

works for multitasking so if you're in

an app and you want a multitask you just

swipe up in the bottom you pause for

split second and you're in multitasking

and then you can tap on any app and jump

right to it

we also use the home button for Siri so

how are we going to do that now well of

course you can just speak to your phone

as before and say hey Siri

now I didn't study ones phones off or

you can now press the side button in

which has been made larger once you

press it in you can just talk to Siri I

know what you're thinking about what

about unlocking how do you unlock your

phone with iPhone 10 I mean this has

been very important part of the iPhone

user experience from the very beginning

the first iPhone we led the way with

multi-touch and we created slide to

unlock and there's protected the iPhone

from turning on when you didn't want it

to like in your pocket

starting with iPhone 5s we invented

touch ID made it fast and easy to

protect all your data and unlock your

phone with just your fingerprint and

touch ID became the gold standard in

consumer device biometric protection but

we know we can do something that's

better the iPhone 10 your iPhone is

locked until you look at it and it

recognizes you nothing has ever been

simpler more natural and effortless we

call this face ID

so face ID is the future of how we will

unlock our smartphones and protect our

sensitive information to make face ID

possible took some of the most advanced

technology we have ever created and much

of it is packed right up here into this

tiny little area at the top of the

display we call this the true depth

camera system and it is made up of

incredible state-of-the-art technology

there's an infrared camera a flood

illuminator the front side camera and a

dot projector and that's not all there's

also the proximity sensor the ambient

light sensor the speaker and microphone

all packed into this true depth camera

system area it is amazing and here's how

it works every time you glance at your

iPhone 10 it detects your face with the

flood a new illuminator even in the dark

the IR camera takes an IR image the dot

projector projects out over 30,000

invisible IR dots we use the IR image in

the dot pattern and we push them through

neural networks to create a mathematical

model of your face and then we check

that mathematical model against the one

that we've stored that you set up

earlier to see if to match and unlock

your phone and this all happens in real

time it all happens invisibly you don't

see these things going off it's

incredible it just all works it all

happens to create face ID we work with

thousands of people around the world and

the team took over a billion images and

with that they developed multiple neural

networks to create face ID and to

process the machine learning and face ID

these neural networks we built Apple's

first-ever neural engine yeah this is a

big deal in our pockets in our phones is

an A 11 Bionic chip with a built in

neural engine to process face

recognition

now the neural engine a specialized

hardware built for a specific set of

machine learning algorithms this is

another example of the incredible

collaboration between the hardware and

software teams it's only possible at

Apple the neural engine is a

state-of-the-art ultra-fast processing

system it uses our highest density

computing ever it's a dual core design

it can perform over 600 billion

operations per second and it's used to

the real-time processing of face ID

recognition but for all of us us it's

just super easy and fun to use when you

set up face ID you just follow the

on-screen instructions and it tells you

how to move your head around in the

camera so fess ID can recognize your

face and that's it you do that once when

you set it up and face ID learns your

face even if you change your hairstyle

you decide to put on glasses you're

wearing a hat so you do it up any way

you do it face ID learns your face it

learns who you are and it adapts to you

as your face changes over time let's say

you start to grow a beard it works in

day it works at night and the teens work

hard to make sure the face ID can easily

be spoofed by things like photographs he

even gone and worked with professional

mask makers and makeup artists in

Hollywood to protect against these

attempts to beat face ID these are

actual masks used by the engineering

team to train the neural networks to

protect against them and face ID it's

incredible the team's worked hard to

protect your face data yes

your face state is protected with the

secure Enclave and the a 11 Bionic chip

all the processing is done on iphone 10

and not sent to a server we require user

attention to unlock that means if your

eyes are closed you're looking away it's

not going to unlock now how do we

compare that to touch ID how secure is

it well there's no perfect system not

even biometric ones but as we said

earlier touch ID is the gold standard

for consumer device biometric protection

and the data for touch ID has been one

in 50,000 meaning that the chance that a

random person could use their

fingerprint to unlock your iPhone has

been about 1 in 50,000 and it's been

great so what are the similar statistics

for face ID one-in-a-million

the chance that a random person in the

population could look at your iPhone 10

and unlock it with their face is about

one in a million

of course the statistics are lower if

that person shares a close genetic

relationship with you so for example if

you happen to have an evil twin you

really need to protect your passcode

where your sensitive data with a

passcode hopefully you don't face ID

also works with Apple pay so to pay for

things you just double tap the button on

the side you look at iPhone 10 to

authenticate and hold it near the

payment terminal to pay it's that easy

fast intuitive simple base ID also works

with third party apps their party apps

already support touch ID and they'll

work with face ID so apps like mint one

password etrade will all work with face

ID so face ID it's faith on face

authentication for unlocking your iPhone

and protecting your sensitive data

it used the innovative to depth camera

system

it's trained with neural networks it's

easy to set up it learns your face and

it adapts to your face over time it's

aware of your attention

it works with Apple pay and it works

with third-party apps this too def

camera system is incredible technology

and it's going to enable so many great

new user experiences the first one of

course is face ID but the team decided

to create another great experience with

it as well this is a fun one it has to

do with emojis and we use emojis to

communicate with others and to express

emotion but of course you can't

customize emojis they only have a

limited amount of expressiveness to them

so our team created something called an

emoji these are animated emojis

these are emojis that you control with

your face in emojis track more than 50

facial muscle movements they've been

meticulously animated to create amazing

expressiveness you just watch this can

you the way you create and share an

emoji are right from within Apple

messages you said literally where are

you you can pick from a dozen different

animated emojis to share and express

whatever you want express your family

and friends so iPhone 10 is packed with

innovative technologies that enable new

user experiences I'm really excited to

invite out Craig federighi to show you I

phone 10 and what it's like to use it

for the very first time great everybody

Wow well I'm absolutely thrilled to be

able to give all of you your first live

look at I phone 10 this is a phone we've

been dreaming about for a long time but

the reality of it in your hand it's it's

really something epic so let's take a

look here is iPhone 10 now unlocking it

is as easy as looking at it and swiping

up and you know to try that again

oh-ho-ho let's uh go to back up here and

get right in so here we are and you see

this expansive display it's just a

beautiful canvas for all of your content

and your gestures now I'm just gonna go

into the weather app here and you can

just see how apps look when they take

advantage of the edge to edge display

now exiting an app couldn't be easier

you just swipe from the bottom just like

this and throw the app right back on the

home screen let me do that again

just swipe right up let's take a look at

the web it just looks unbelievable edge

to edge on this display and your photos

of course are just gorgeous as well

let's jump into this one just amazing

now video of course is unbelievable on

the super Retina display it looks great

in portrait and in landscape of course

this is HDR video just incredible

looking now Phil told you a little bit

about multitasking on the device let me

show you I'm just gonna jump into maps

if I want to move between my

applications I can just swipe up and

stop my other apps all come in I can get

at them with a tab just lift it's just

that easy and we have a great shortcut

as well you can actually move back with

tween apps just by swiping along the

bottom like this it's really easy now

you may be wondering about control

center and worry not right where your

status indicators are in the upper right

hand corner you can just swipe down and

get a control center from anywhere it's

that easy now let's take a look again at

face ID because unlocking your phone is

just amazingly intuitive you just raise

it look at it and swipe right up to get

started

but now it's also incredibly fast so I'm

just gonna do that again I just raise it

look at it

swipe I don't have to wait and it's also

really really smart so let's say I wake

my phone and I'm not looking at it stays

locked but once I give it my once I give

it my attention well it unlocks and I

can get right in it's really cool now

face idea is also great for Apple pay so

if I'm at the register I can just double

click on the side button

I'm authenticated and I can get in just

like that now the true depth camera

behind face ID isn't just about

authentication in fact we've extended AR

kit with some incredible new face

tracking capabilities that provide a

whole new class of augmented reality

experiences now we've been working on

one with snapchat and I'd like to show

it to you now so I'm gonna launch in you

see it builds a mesh in my face and now

I can just select a mask the tracking is

just unreal let's check out this one now

look at the detail over the eyes the

incredible metallic reflections the

quality of the tracking it's it's just

stunning

now of course many of us like to

communicate with emoji and with an emoji

we can now breathe our own personality

into our favorites it's available as an

app right inside a messages I can just

go right in here and it immediately

starts tracking me so I can make

whatever expression I want like and just

pick that up and use it as a sticker

drop it on my message like that we also

let you manipulate these in full-screen

you can audition your favorites there's

some really great ones like the kitty

cat so expressive and ferocious it's a

happy puppy

check out the physics in the ears the

pig we've got a chicken and the unicorn

mythical creature favorite of the

startup

and yes if you were by chance wondering

what humanity would do when given access

to the most advanced facial tracking

technology available you now have your

answer now these can be so much fun

you're gonna want to share them

unfortunately we let you record messages

I'm gonna record a message here for Tim

hey Tim I'm not sure what the protocol

is here but I'd like to call dibs on the

box for my favorite emoji which one do

you like hey Tim I'm not sure what the

protocol is here but I'd like to call

dibs on the box for my favorite emoji

which one do you like now you can send

it with just a tap and it appears as a

looping video right inside the

transcript we're really lucky for our

grand finale we might just get a

response back from Tim oh here it is

let's let's take a look take me to your

leader

wait a minute Craig I am your leader

let's wrap this thing up

so that is your first look at the new

iPhone 10 and the amazing experience

with the true depth camera and an emoji

I think you're gonna love it thank you

very much

Thank You Craig now let's talk about the

amazing cameras in iphone 10 iphone 10

has dual 12 12 megapixel sensors the

dual cameras both a faster sensors wider

sensor it's just like an iPhone 8 as new

color filters new deeper pixels there's

an F 1.8 aperture on the wide-angle

camera and a faster F 2.4 aperture on a

telephoto so that lets in 36 percent

more light to the telephoto camera but

the big news on the camera in the iPhone

10 is it as dual optical image

stabilization that means there's OIS

about the wide-angle in the telephoto

lens that's a lot of magnets moving

around in a very small space but it

helps with compensating for handshake

and to take better photos and videos in

low-light there's also a better quad led

two-tone flash that is twice the

uniformity of light on our subjects so

let's look at some photos taken from the

backside camera on iPhone 10 this is

absolutely beautiful great dynamic range

detail low noise is a beautiful photo

the textures are simply stunning

now there's zero shutter lag and it

helps to freeze motion so we can get a

photo like this look at that blue sky

with low noise it's absolutely to die

for

the OIS delivers the low-light

performance so now you can get

incredible low-light images like this

with the telephoto camera as well as the

wide-angle an iPhone 10 is fantastic for

the portrait mode feature that we all

love iPhone 10 you get great portrait

modes especially in lower light an

iPhone 10 supports the brand-new

portrait lighting feature as well that's

again a photo taken right off of iPhone

10 not retouched in any way with a stage

lighting effect dropping out the

background

iPhone 10 is great for photos it's

amazing for 4k video and like iPhone 8

it's tuned for a our applications as

factory calibrated cameras the new

gyroscope accelerometer the performance

advantage of the a11 Bionic chips CPU

GPU and ISP and a our kit is tuned for

iPhone 10 now the backside camera that

we use so much it's not the only camera

of course on the iPhone we have our

front side camera as well and people

love to use those for taking selfie

photographs and now with iPhone 10 and

its true depth camera it really delivers

a breakthrough into the photos you can

take for selfies because now with

selfies you can take portrait mode

photos as well and it also supports

portrait lighting all through the front

side to depth camera

and people gonna be blown away with the

selfies you can take with the iPhone 10

this is absolutely beautiful of course

everything we've seen is powered an

iPhone 10 by the amazing new a 11 Bionic

chip we talked all about an iPhone 8 but

it's worth hitting on the highlights

again because there has never been

anything like it a 64-bit 6 core

designed 4.3 billion transistors to

high-performance course for high

efficiency cores our new

second-generation performance controller

that uses all six cores at once our

first Apple design graphics processing

unit the brand new ISP that improves

autofocus the video encoder that is

real-time motion analysis while you're

shooting video the neural engine and of

course the secure Enclave to protect our

face ID data all this performance I'm

sure as you expect does come with a hit

to battery life so I think it's

important to tell you that we've

increased it yes it lasts

again hard when saw pertains work really

hard to deliver two more hours of

all-day battery life to us so wireless

just like iPhone 8 iPhone 10 is also

built for a wireless world it is Qi

charging through the glass back and it

will work with the Qi charging devices

like the ones that we mention earlier

from Mophie and Belkin they also work

with third-party Qi devices that are Qi

certified and there are a lot of great

devices they're gonna start to come to

market particularly because of iPhone 8

knife own 10 but we also think we can

make the wireless charging experience

even better so our team wants to create

something I think all of us we're gonna

want to use and it might actually help

move the entire industry forward so

we're gonna give you a sneak peek of

this idea right now I'm sure many of you

do this I do this I have a lot of Apple

products I love them and use them all

day long I charge them at night you plug

in your cables you plug in your chargers

you take those cables and charges with

you on the road when you travel we think

we have an idea of how to make this a

better experience and here it is it's a

mat that you place your iPhone 8 or

iPhone 10 down and it just starts to

charge and there's a beautiful new

interface it doesn't stop there you can

place your Series 3 Apple watch down on

it and it starts to charge as well and

you can place your ear pods or the

optional new wireless charging case on

it and it starts to charge as well they

all charge

this system has a great interface the

intelligently worked together and

communicate with each other to manage

the charging through one more efficient

charging system this is not possible

with current standards but our team

knows how to do this we call it air

power we hope people love it

that encourages others to create more

advanced solutions based on technology

like this we're gonna be working with

the chief standards team to incorporate

these benefits into the future of the

standards to make wireless charging

better for everyone so look for the air

power charger next year so that is

iPhone 10 it is the future of the

smartphone it is packed with many

innovative features huge lists we won't

go through them all they add up to a new

better experience we're so excited about

iPhone 10 they created a beautiful video

to tell you all about it for more than a

decade our intention has been to create

an iPhone that is all display a physical

object that disappears into the

experience

this is iPhone 10 developing the fulmen

display together defines a whole new

integration making the boundary between

the device and the screen hard to

discern the custom OLED panel was

engineered to fold and seamlessly

combined with the external surfaces

mechanical buttons give way to touch in

gestures there's no home button a single

swipe takes you to the home screen a

more responsive touch system means the

gestures in iOS 11 are more fluid the

polished stainless steel band reinforces

the water-resistant all glass design

this new glass formulation their most

durable ever in a smartphone enables for

the first time wireless charging our new

true depth camera system contained

within this tiny space use his

extraordinary depth sensing technology

to let you unlock your phone with a

glance

we call this face ID it maps the unique

geometry of your face with over 30,000

invisible dots this data is analyzed by

the neural engine on the a11 bio

leadership the first of its kind your

iPhone now recognizes you even in the

dark and will adapt to your physical

changes this makes your face your secure

password so with just a look you can

authenticate your phone or use Apple pay

the true depth camera also enables new

experiences like bringing emojis to life

by mapping more than 50 facial muscles

in real time so you can be happy or sad

or cross both the front and rear facing

cameras now have full frame mode and for

the first time you can actually define

the light in a scene

based on fundamentals photographic

principles portrayed lighting produces

the effect of real studio lighting

on the back the dual camera system is

completely redesigned it's made even

smarter by the a11 Bionic chip with

machine learning the camera detects

elements in the scene to optimize the

image before the photo is even taken the

camera we use every day mail delivers so

much more and as iOS becomes the world's

largest platform for augmented reality

it will redefine what's possible

this is iPhone

the team works hard to make iPhone 8 an

iPhone 10 in the most environmentally

friendly manner possible

if arsenic-free display glass

mercury-free displays their BFR free PVC

free beryllium free but now made with a

low carbon process for their aluminum

design and their highly recyclable with

their materials really proud of that

less so I like to say it every time

iPhone 10 also comes in two

configurations 64 gigs and 256 gigabytes

they'll be priced from $9.99 you can

order it starting on October 27th and

they begin to ship on November 3rd so

this is the future the smartphone

shipping this year so this is our lineup

for the holidays now every year we say

it's a great lineup for the holidays and

it is but this year is really special

it starts with iPhone se iPhone 6s

iphone 7 the new generation iPhone 8 and

the futuristic iPhone 10

ten years ago when Steve introduced the

world to iPhone he closed with a quote

from Wayne Gretzky it said I skate to

where the puck is going to be not where

it has been Steve said that's what Apple

does we skate to where the puck is going

to be and that is what iPhone 10 is all

about thank you doctor you

iPhone 10 this really is the future

we've made a great fun new ad that I'd

love to show it to you

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

that is iPhone 10 thank you thank you

thank you

so one a morning we've had Apple watch

series three with cellular which gives

you the freedom to go anywhere you want

with or without your iPhone Apple TV 4k

brings the magic of the cinema straight

to your living room with incredible 4k

and HDR content iPhone a a beautiful

glass design incredible cameras wireless

charging a 11 Bionic ship and of course

powerful AR capabilities we think you're

going to love it an iPhone 10 the most

advanced iPhone we've ever made

the incredible new design face ID true

depth camera system and more powerful

technologies than we've ever put in an

iPhone before it really is the future of

the smartphone and we begin this morning

with some inspiring words from Steve one

of the ways that I believe people

express their appreciation to the rest

of humanity is to make something

wonderful and put it out there we work

really hard at Apple to create wonderful

things and we hope you love what we've

introduced today I think Steve would be

really proud of them

[Applause]

I'd like to thank everyone at Apple who

made today possible I'd like everybody

an apple to stand up that are here

representing their teams from hardware

and software and services please stand

up in operations are amazing retail

employees

[Applause]

and everyone that works so hard on this

theater and on Apple Park one of the

great things about this theater is an

unbelievable hands-on area it is the

most beautiful hands-on area we've ever

had by far and I would encourage all of

you to join us there and get your hands

on these wonderful products thank you so

much for spending the morning with us

thank you

[Applause]
