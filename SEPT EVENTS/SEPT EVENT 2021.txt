Good morning,
and thank you for joining us.

I really love the incredible energy
in that opening.

It represents the way we feel
about California.

California has always been a place for
people with big ambitions and big dreams,

a place where people are fueled
with optimism to make things better,

to make things that can change the world.

It's such an important part
of who we are at Apple,

and inspires us
in everything we create and do.

We're proud to call California our home.

We have a lot to talk about today.

Let's get started with Apple TV+.

Apple TV+ is a home
to the world's most creative storytellers,

and continues to expand
with award-winning programming.

Apple Original series, films,
and documentaries have now been honored

with more than 130 wins

and over 500 nominations
in less than two years.

We're so proud this year
that Apple TV+

has 35 Primetime Emmy nominations,

including 20 for "Ted Lasso,"

a record for the first season
of a comedy series.

And we're just getting started.

Let's take a quick look at a few shows
that are premiering this fall.

I can't wait for all the new shows
and movies coming to Apple TV+,

including the second season of one
of my favorites, "The Morning Show,"

which starts this Friday.

Next, we're thrilled to share our newest
product announcements,

starting with iPad.

There's no other device like iPad,

and today, it's more popular
and more essential than ever.

And the reason it's so popular
is its amazing versatility.

It can transform into
whatever you need it to be.

With advanced displays,
users can literally touch their content,

unlike any other device.

With powerful
and efficient Apple designed chips,

iPad delivers breathtaking
performance all day long.

And with fast connectivity,
advanced cameras,

and accessories like the Magic Keyboard
and Apple Pencil,

iPad becomes even more versatile,

extending what users can do on iPad
and where they can do it.

At the heart of it all is iPadOS

delivering powerful features,

while maintaining the simplicity
of a touch-first experience.

What makes iPad even more versatile
are the over 1 million apps

designed specifically
for its large canvas.

The iPad business has never been stronger.

We've grown by over 40% this past year.

We have a great lineup today

with industry-leading
customer satisfaction,

and it's about to get even stronger.

It starts with our most popular iPad,
which delivers the full iPad experience

at an incredible affordable price.

And today it gets even better.

This is the new iPad,

and to tell you all about it,
here's Melody.

This new iPad is packed full
of updates, so let's jump in.

Under the hood is
a more powerful chip, A13 Bionic.

And it pushes even further
than the speedy A12 from last year's iPad

with 20% faster performance
in every aspect of the chip

from the CPU and GPU
to the Neural Engine.

A13 is leaps ahead of the competition.

In fact, it makes this iPad
up to three times faster

than the best-selling Chromebook

and up to six times faster
than the best-selling Android tablet.

And it means users will see
even more responsive performance

for all the things they love
to do on iPad,

from everyday uses like messaging
and browsing the web

to playing immersive,
high-quality games.

And as users explore more advanced apps
like Adobe Fresco

with its super realistic water colors,

A13 delivers the performance they need
and then some.

And the more powerful Neural Engine in A13

makes next-generation
machine learning experiences

like Live Text in iPadOS 15 even faster.

The upgraded image signal processor in A13

also means the rear camera
captures great photos

with improved autofocus in low light,

and better selfies
from the front camera as well.

Now, the front camera on iPad is essential

for things like remote learning
and connecting with family.

And that's why we're so thrilled
to give it a big upgrade.

It's now a 12 MP Ultra Wide camera
that produces a huge leap in image quality

and enables a super popular feature
from iPad Pro,

and that's Center Stage.

We're bringing
the magical Center Stage experience

from iPad Pro to this new iPad.

Enabled by the Ultra Wide front camera
and the Neural Engine,

Center Stage makes video calls
more engaging

by automatically detecting people
and dynamically adjusting the frame

as they move around
or as more people join in.

It works in landscape orientation
and portrait,

so users can enjoy Center Stage
in all the ways they use iPad.

Not only does Center Stage work
in FaceTime,

it makes video calls more natural
in other popular apps,

like Zoom, BlueJeans, and Webex.

And it's not just
for video conferencing.

Users can record, stream,
and post Center Stage video

in apps like DoubleTake,
Explain Everything, and TikTok.

It makes you more productive on iPad,
and it's simply more fun.

Another new feature coming to this iPad
that users love is True Tone.

It adjusts the display
to the color temperature of a room

to provide a more comfortable
viewing experience.

And by retaining the same popular design,

this iPad supports a vast array
of accessories,

including the thin
and light Smart Keyboard,

and third party keyboards
like Logitech's latest rugged combo

with trackpad for schools.

And of course, this iPad supports
the first-generation Apple Pencil,

where iPadOS makes the experience
of using Apple Pencil

as easy and natural as pen and paper.

And this new iPad will ship
with iPadOS 15,

which is packed
with great new features.

For example,
you can place widgets among your apps,

making important information
available with just a glance.

New multitasking controls make it even
easier to launch and use multiple apps.

Quick Note gives you a fast and easy way
to take notes anywhere.

And the list goes on.

iPadOS is so immensely capable
and so easy to use.

When you combine it
with a beautiful display, great cameras,

broad accessory support,
Gigabit-class LTE,

and all-day battery life,
this iPad delivers enormous value

because this new iPad starts at just $329.

And that's with twice the storage,
starting at 64 gigabytes.

For schools,
it's even more affordable at just $299.

It comes in Space Gray and Silver,
and cellular models are available as well.

You can order the new iPad today,
and it will be available next week.

With the power of A13 Bionic,

a new 12 MP Ultra Wide front camera
with Center Stage,

True Tone, double the storage,
and the versatility of iPadOS 15,

this is a giant upgrade
for our most popular iPad.

Now back to Tim.

We're excited that our most popular
iPad is now so much better.

And now let's talk about iPad mini.

There's simply no other device
like iPad mini.

It gives users all the power of iPad
in its most portable form,

which makes it indispensable
for a wide range of uses,

like when it's secured to the leg
of a pilot in flight

or pulled from a doctor's lab coat
to care for patients in the ER.

iPad mini is in a class of its own.

And today we're giving our littlest iPad
its biggest upgrade ever.

Introducing the all-new iPad mini.

As Tim said, we're giving iPad mini
a huge set of updatesâ€“

a complete redesign that puts everything
our users love about iPad

right in the palm of their hand.

The all-new enclosure features
a beautiful all-screen design

with narrow borders
and elegant rounded corners.

The design is remarkably thin and light
and absolutely stunning.

And iPad mini now comes
in a gorgeous array of new colors.

Purple, Pink, Starlight,
and Space Gray.

And this design features
a brilliant Liquid Retina display.

With this new design we were able
to increase the screen size

all the way out to 8.3 inches,
while keeping the same compact footprint.

With wide color, True Tone,
500 nits of brightness,

and the lowest reflectivity
in the industry,

everything you view on iPad mini
will look great wherever you go.

And delivering this edge-to-edge screen
meant finding a new location for Touch ID.

So just like iPad Air, we put it
right in the top button of iPad mini.

Touch ID is fast, easy, and secure,

whether you're unlocking your iPad
or using ApplePay.

iPad mini is already
the fastest device of its kind,

and the performance of the new iPad mini
is simply remarkable.

Compared to the previous generation,

the new iPad mini sees a 40% jump
in CPU performance

and a whopping 80% leap
in GPU performance.

So whether you're using ForeFlight

to navigate your flight plan
with live wind speed overlays

or playing the graphically rich game
"Star Wars: Hunters"

online with your friends,

the new iPad mini will power
right through it with ease.

And the Neural Engine, for powerful
machine learning applications,

also takes a big leap forward
on the new mini,

increasing performance by up to two times
over the previous generation.

Combined with the CPU and the GPU,

the Neural Engine enables apps

to deliver next-level experiences.

Like the new Translate app
in iPadOS 15,

which can automatically
translate a conversation in real time.

The performance of the new iPad mini
is on a whole new level.

And we know that iPad users rely
on ultra-fast connections.

Well, the most mobile iPad
is about to get a lot faster

and even more versatile.

iPad mini now has a USB-C port,

so you get
the same great USB-C functionality

that we brought to iPad Air,

which means it is up to ten times faster
than its predecessor.

So iPad mini can now connect
to a vast ecosystem of USB-C accessories,

which is great,
whether you're a photographer

who needs to connect to cameras
when shooting on location

or a doctor in a remote area
using Butterfly to conduct an ultrasound.

And when users are on the go,

it's crucial to have access
to the fastest cellular connections,

and that's why we're bringing 5G
to iPad mini.

Download speeds can be
up to 3.5 gigabits per second.

This is key when you need
to stay connected on the go,

like when technicians use Splunk AR
on-site

to access real time data,
performance analytics,

and complex schematics.

Or if you're using SharePlay
to take a MasterClass

with your friends.

5G keeps you connected.

Next, let's talk about
the cameras and audio.

Users rely on iPad mini for FaceTime,

taking photos and videos,
and experiencing AR,

so we've updated both the front
and back cameras.

The back camera now features
a 12 megapixel sensor with Focus Pixels

and a larger aperture

to capture sharp, vivid photos.

And we added a True Tone flash to mini
for improved photos in low light.

With a new ISP, users will see
enhanced photos with Smart HDR,

which improves image quality by recovering
details in shadows and highlights.

And now with the ability to record in 4K,

iPad mini becomes
your mobile movie studio.

On the front, iPad mini features
the new 12 MP Ultra Wide camera,

which means it also supports Center Stage.

As Melody mentioned,
this has been a huge hit on iPad Pro,

and now it's coming to iPad mini.

And iPad mini also features a new speaker
system with stereo in landscape,

great for listening
to your favorite playlist

or doing an Apple Fitness+ workout
in your hotel room.

And iPad mini's versatility is further
enhanced by its amazing accessories.

There's a new set of slim Smart Folio
covers in beautiful coordinating colors

that complement
the new iPad mini finishes,

perfect for expressing
your personal style.

And now, iPad mini supports the amazing
second-generation Apple Pencil,

which magnetically attaches
to the side of iPad mini

so it's always connected,
charged, and with you.

Apple Pencil transforms iPad mini
into your digital sketch book,

We're so excited about the new iPad mini.

Let's see it in action.

With its all-new design
and huge boost in performance,

the new iPad mini starts at just $499,

and it'll be available in both Wi-Fi
and cellular configurations.

You can order it today,
and it will be available next week.

So this is the all-new iPad mini

featuring a brilliant
liquid retina display,

super fast performance,

new cameras front and back,

Center Stage, 5G,
support for Apple Pencil,

and all-new colors.

With all of these new features,

this is by far the most powerful
and versatile iPad mini ever.

And with both the new iPad and iPad mini,

we continue our commitment
to the environment.

Both of these iPad models are built
with a 100% recycled aluminum enclosure.

And this marks a milestone for iPad.

Every single iPad in the lineup

now features
a 100% recycled aluminum enclosure.

This is just one of the many
ongoing efforts we have underway

to reduce the environmental impact
of our products.

Now back to Tim.

With the even more capable new iPad
and the phenomenal new iPad mini,

our iPad lineup
is the best it's ever been.

Next, let's talk about Apple Watch.

Apple Watch is
an indispensable daily companion

that keeps you connected to the people
and things you care about most.

It encourages you to be active
and get more out of your workouts.

And it monitors your health,
helping you live a better day.

I am so inspired by the impact
we've had on people's lives,

and we continue to push the boundaries
of what Apple Watch can do.

To tell you about what's next,
here's Jeff.

Being more active

is one of the best ways to stay healthy.

And it's been at the heart of Apple Watch

since the beginning.

Well, today we're adding new features
to Apple Watch

for everyone who rides a bike.

watchOS 8 will detect when you begin
riding and remind you to start a workout.

And it will automatically pause and resume
if you stop temporarily.

And watchOS 8 adds Fall Detection
to cycling

by sensing the unique motion
and impact of falls while riding a bike.

And Apple Watch
now better supports e-bikes

with an improved workout algorithm
that more accurately calculates calories.

These cycling updates join all
the other great additions in watchOS 8,

like the Mindfulness app
and Memories in Photos.

And this year we focused on
making these features

and everything you do on Watch
bigger and better.

Introducing...

the next generation of Apple Watch.

This is the incredible
Apple Watch Series 7.

It takes all the great features
of Apple Watch and combines them

with our largest
and most advanced display ever.

The new Retina display on Series 7 has
nearly 20% more screen area than Series 6.

And it's an even bigger jump over Series 3
with over 50% more screen area.

The Series 7 display
has been completely reengineered

to reduce the borders
to just 1.7 millimeters.

That's 40% thinner than on Series 6.

It's an incredible innovation
that maximizes the screen area

while barely changing the dimensions
of the watch itself.

And the shape of the watch
has also been refined.

Both the case and the display of Series 7
have softer, more rounded corners.

The new display refracts light at
its edges for a subtle wrap around effect,

creating a seamless integration
with the curvature of the case.

And it's also up to 70% brighter indoors
when your wrist is down,

making it even easier
to discreetly check the time.

This new display is an industry first

and we fully optimized the user interface
for it.

Here's Lauren to tell you more.

Across the user interface
on Series 7,

buttons have been redesigned and enlarged

to complement the size and shape
of the new display,

like in Stopwatch,

Activity, and Alarms,

making them even easier to tap.

It can also fit nearly 50% more text
onscreen than Series 6.

This helps you read Messages and emails
with a lot less scrolling.

Series 7 also features
new ways to input text.

There's a full keyboard
that you can either tap

or slide from letter to letter
with QuickPath,

which uses machine learning
to predict the word you're typing.

There are also new watch faces
designed specifically for Series 7.

The dynamic Contour face
animates on wrist-raise,

pushing the dial right out to the edge.

And a new Modular face
leverages the extra screen area

with two large,
data-rich center complications.

All of these improvements give Series 7
the best user experience

of any Apple Watch.

We also improved durability,

which is another essential aspect
of Apple Watch.

Series 7 is the most durable Apple Watch
we've ever built.

It has our most crack-resistant
front crystal,

thanks to a stronger
and more robust geometry.

It's also the first Apple Watch
to have IP6X certification,

so you don't have to worry about
wearing it in dusty environments.

And of course, it's still swim-proof
with WR50 water resistance.

With our best-ever durability,

you can take Series 7
anywhere you want to go.

And use it all-day long
with the same, great 18-hour battery life.

Series 7 also has
an improved charging experience.

It charges up to 33% faster than Series 6.

With an updated charging architecture
and new fast-charging USB-C cable,

it takes just 45 minutes
to go from 0 to 80% charge.

And 8 minutes of charging is enough
for 8 hours of Sleep Tracking.

We think customers will love
the optimized user interface,

best-ever durability,
and faster charging of Series 7.

Now back to Jeff.

Series 7 will be available
in five new aluminum colors,

Midnight, Starlight,
Green, Blue, and PRODUCT(RED).

It will also be available in silver,
graphite, and gold stainless steel,

as well as in natural
and space black titanium.

Apple Watch Nike models
feature a new graphic Sport Loop

and Nike Bounce watch face.

And there's a new Apple Watch Hermes
Circuit H leather band with matching face,

plus, an elegant new Double Tour band.

Now, of course, bands are a great way
to customize your Apple Watch

for any activity or occasion,

so we've added new colors
across our most popular styles.

And Series 7 is compatible
with all existing bands.

We've designed Series 7
with the environment in mind.

All aluminum watch cases are made
with 100% recycled metal

and all magnets in Series 7 use 100%
recycled rare earth elements.

So here's our 2021 Apple Watch lineup.

Series 3 remains
at the great entry price of $199.

Apple Watch SE starts at $279.

And Apple Watch Series 7 starts at $399.

Series 7 will be available
later this year,

and we can't wait for you to try it.

Here's another look
at some of the amazing capabilities

of Apple Watch Series 7.

To live is to ask the big questions.

Like, "Why are we here?"

"What is our purpose?

And "Whoa!
How fast was that serve?"

98 miles per hour. Nice.

But I was thinking ideas aboutâ€“
wow.

Excuse me? Yeah, how far was that drive?

250 yards.

Okay, getting back to my point,
I mean, haven't you ever wondered--

How far have I gone?

5 miles.

Average speed: 12.4 miles per hour.

That is how far you've gone.

But I was actually thinking--

wait, are you taking an ECG here?

And you're taking one here?

Are you taking an ECG next to a piÃ±ata?

Heads up!

Oh, we're surfing.

Wow, that's justâ€“

that's just impressive.

Wait, how many waves you get?

15 waves.

Oh, good morning.
How did you sleep?

Why are you checking
your blood oxygen level?

Oh, that's why.

Okay, let's get back to the big questions,
like,

are the mysteries of the universe
out of reach?

Or can we discover the answers
through the power of meditation?

Oh, come on, now!

You know you're levitating, right?

Sorry. Don't mind me.

Anyway, there are questions,
and it seems like

your watch has all the answers,
which is cheating.

So that's Apple Watch Series 7.

It has the largest
and most advanced display ever,

an optimized UI with new keyboard
and watch faces,

best-ever durability,
fast charging, new colors,

and all the great features
of watchOS 8.

Series 7 is simply
our best Apple Watch yet,

and there's no better way
to stay connected, active, and healthy.

And a great way to stay active and healthy
with Apple Watch is with Apple Fitness+.

I'll hand it over to Jay
to give you an update.

Apple Fitness+ is the first
fitness service designed entirely

With Apple Watch Series 7,
the most advanced smart watch ever,

and the incredible new content
and features in Apple Fitness+,

we can't wait to see the impact
they're sure to have on our users' lives.

Now let's talk about iPhone.

iPhone has forever changed the world.

Every single day people rely on iPhone,
from their most demanding tasks,

to capturing the moments of their lives,
streaming their favorite TV shows,

playing their favorite games,

staying up-to-date
with the news of the world,

and connecting with friends
and loved ones.

This is what drives us
to create the best iPhone possible,

to create an experience unlike any other
with legendary ease of use,

beautiful and durable designs,

with water resistance
and great battery life,

with industry leading performance,

and the world's
most advanced camera systems,

and with privacy built in.

People love iPhone.

And we keep making iPhone better,

more powerful, more capable,
and even more fun to use.

Today we are thrilled to introduce
our next generation of iPhone.

Here it is.

This is iPhone 13.

To tell you more, here's Kaiann.

Let's take a closer look
at iPhone 13 starting with design.

It has the sleek,
flat-edged design that people love.

It's also incredibly durable
with our exclusive Ceramic Shield front,

tougher than any smartphone glass,

and has industry leading
IP68 water resistance.

iPhone 13 has a new look
for the advanced dual-camera system

with the lenses arranged diagonally.

The aerospace-grade aluminum frame
is beautifully formed

and really shows off five new colors:

an all-new Pink, Blue, Midnight,
Starlight, and (PRODUCT)RED.

On the front, the TrueDepth camera system
has been reengineered

to provide more display area.

Everything inside, including Face ID,

the most secure facial authentication
in a smartphone,

fits into a space that's 20% smaller.

iPhone 13 is designed
with the environment in mind,

using many recycled materials.

For example, these antenna lines
use upcycled plastic water bottles,

an industry first.

Under the hood, iPhone 13 has
been completely re-architected

to make room for new technologies
and a bigger battery.

This beautiful design is the same
across two sizes,

iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini.

Both feature a more advanced
Super Retina XDR display.

It's 28% brighter, up to 800 nits,

brilliant for viewing
even when you're outside.

For HDR content like photos and videos,

the peak brightness is higher
at 1200 nits.

And you can enjoy
the pixel-precision brightness for longer

thanks to the display's
improved power efficiency.

You'll see true blacks in games,
photos, and videos

with the incredible contrast ratio
of our OLED display.

This new brighter
Super Retina XDR display

delivers an immersive viewing experience

with support for Dolby Vision,
HDR10, and HLG.

Now let's talk about the chip

that powers iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini.

Frankly, the competition
is still playing catch-up to our chips,

not just from last year,
but even from two years ago.

And today,
we're extending our lead with A15 Bionic.

Here's Hope to tell you all about it.

Our silicon is the engine of iPhone.

With A15 Bionic, we have innovations
across the entire system

to deliver more performance
and power efficiency,

At its foundation,
A15 uses five nanometer technology,

which enables us to include
nearly 15 billion transistors.

You'll absolutely fly through demanding
workloads smoothly and efficiently

thanks to a powerful new 6-core CPU

with two high-performance
and four high-efficiency cores.

We've increased the performance

of our CPU's
dedicated machine learning accelerators

that power experiences
such as advanced text-to-speech in Siri

and on-device processing of directions
in Maps.

It's the fastest CPU in any smartphone,

up to 50% faster
than the leading competition,

For graphics-intensive tasks,
like advanced games,

A15 Bionic features our latest 4-core GPU,

enabling more eye-catching visuals
and lighting effects.

It delivers up to 30% faster graphics
versus the leading competition.

And we continue to push the limits
of machine learning

with the new 16-core Neural Engine
that is perfect for ML tasks.

It's capable of an astounding
15.8 trillion operations per second.

We design our Neural Engine together

with our camera hardware
and software teams.

This unique vision and integration
brings to life leading capabilities

in video and image processing.

This means faster ML computations
for experiences

like Live Text with iOS 15.

Point your camera at text on the go
and instantly take action,

like buying tickets or getting directions.

The ML advancements across our entire chip
will empower developers

to do even more in their apps,
like SwingVision,

which can smoothly run
powerful CoreML and AR models

on A15 Bionic for real-time shot tracking,

video analysis, and remote coaching.

PeakVisor helps you navigate the outdoors
to identify mountains

and explore detail-rich 3D maps
while hiking.

And Seek uses a machine learning model
trained by over 20 million photos

to instantly identify plants
and animals around you,

and all the processing is done on-device.

A15 is a powerhouse.

In addition
to core performance improvements,

there's a new display engine,

new video encoder and decoder,

and twice the system cache.

There's nothing in the world
like this chip.

Back to Kaiann.

Kaiann: A15 Bionic also powers
the amazing camera system on iPhone 13.

It combines our powerful cameras,

next-generation image signal processor,

and computational photography to create
our most advanced dual-camera system.

The all-new Wide camera lets you take
stunning shots in any situation,

like this photo full of color and texture.

It gathers 47% more light
for less noise and brighter results

in your photos and videos.

This is enabled by larger,
1.7-micron pixels

that capture more light
and a wide f/1.6 aperture.

It's the biggest sensor we've ever put
in our dual-camera system.

iPhone 12 Pro Max introduced
an amazing advanced technology,

sensor-shift optical image stabilization.

And incredibly, we are bringing this
to iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini.

Here's a low-light photo from
the new Wide camera with sensor-shift OIS.

The larger sensor captures
nearly 50% more light.

Hard to believe this photo was taken
in a dark room

with just a little light
coming through a window.

Night mode shots are even more impressive.

Capture times are shorter, too,
for sharper images of your subjects

and fine details.

We've also custom-designed
a new Ultra Wide camera

that will reveal more of the dark areas
with less noise,

like you see here
in the walls and ceilings.

Capturing fun, creative perspectives
is easy with the Ultra Wide

and now it's even better on iPhone 13.

Now let's switch to video.

iPhone already has
the highest quality video in a smartphone.

And iPhone 13 brings a brand-new feature,

Cinematic mode.

Now over to Johnnie to tell you more.

Johnnie: Filmmakers have
used focus changes

to tell engaging stories for decades.

It's a technique called rack focus

that requires skill, planning,
and creative vision.

You've seen rack focus used
in all your favorite films.

It brings a whole new dimension
to storytelling.

Well, we're bringing this capability
to iPhone

in a simple and intuitive way,

so you can capture cinema-style moments,

even if you aren't
a professional filmmaker.

And guess what,
the movie clip you just saw

was shot on iPhone.

And we'd love to show you more.

It's remarkable and so easy to use.

Just start recording,

and Cinematic mode
will hold focus on the subject

even when they're moving.

Focus transitions happen automatically
in real time,

like from one subject to another.

Cinematic mode anticipates when a subject
is about to enter the frame,

and intelligently racks focus
to them when they do,

And when a subject gazes away
from the camera,

iPhone itself changes focus and then back.

To create these automatic focus changes,

we extensively studied the art
of cinematography

and the creative choices directors
of photography make

to guide the viewers' attention.

We combined these learnings

with computational algorithms

so you can effortlessly create
cinema-grade videos.

For more creative control,
you can tap to shift focus at any time.

Tap again to lock
and track focus on the subject.

Cinematic mode shoots
in Dolby Vision HDR.

This is enabled by our Apple-custom sensor

and the incredible power of A15 Bionic,

which grades each frame in Dolby Vision

live while you are recording.

And that's Cinematic mode.

Now back to Kaiann.

iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini

have advanced new camera systems

with sensor-shift OIS,

fantastic low-light performance,

and Cinematic mode
also on the front TrueDepth camera.

Next, let's turn to 5G.

Millions and millions of iPhone users
are already experiencing 5G every day

for super fast downloads and uploads,
lower latency,

and new experiences on the go.

And on iPhone 13, we've innovated further

on custom-designed antennas
and radio components

that let us add more bands

so iPhone 13 works on 5G
with the latest speeds and in more places.

The world is moving quickly to 5G.

We're collaborating
with more carrier partners

for the best call quality,
performance, coverage, and battery life.

By the end of the year,
we will double 5G support

to over 200 carriers
in 60 countries and regions.

That means you can benefit from 5G
in more places than ever

to binge watch your favorite shows
together using SharePlay on Apple TV+

and even more streaming partners
for video and music.

You can be ultra competitive
in multiplayer games,

share surprise greetings from a celebrity
in high res over Cameo,

or take the sound at any live event
to a whole new level with Mix Halo.

5G is taking over,

and iPhone 13 is ready
with the best 5G experience.

Now let's talk about battery life,

which is really important to our users.

iPhone 13 has a faster chip,

faster 5G speeds, a brighter OLED display,

and the most advanced dual-camera system
ever in an iPhone.

And with all these new capabilities,

the iPhone 13 lineup
has better battery life.

On iPhone 13 mini,
most users will experience

an hour and a half hour longer
in their day than with iPhone 12 mini.

And on iPhone 13,
two and a half hours longer

than iPhone 12
for incredible all-day battery life.

This amazing battery life is delivered
by A15 Bionic,

more power-efficient components,
a bigger battery,

and power optimizations from our deep
hardware and software integration,

like Smart Data Mode,
which intelligently conserves battery life

by automatically shifting your iPhone
to LTE when 5G speeds aren't needed.

We also look at every opportunity
to improve privacy.

With iPhone and iOS,
privacy is built in from the beginning.

With iOS 15,
Siri uses on-device speech recognition,

meaning your Siri audio requests
do not leave your iPhone by default.

Intelligent tracking prevention
now prevents trackers from profiling you

using your IP address.

And mail privacy protection
hides your IP address

and prevents senders from learning
about your mail activity.

Another huge benefit of owning an iPhone
is the vast ecosystem

that extends what iPhone can do.

That includes MagSafe,
which we introduced last fall

and has been a hit.

From multi-chargers
and swiveling charger stands

to cases, wallets, tripods,
and car mounts,

along with our own accessories

for charging,
like the MagSafe Battery Pack.

For iPhone 13, we have leather,
silicone, and clear cases

in stunning new colors

and engineered to work perfectly
with MagSafe.

We also have a new MagSafe Leather Wallet

that supports Find My.

You can now be notified
of the last known location

where your wallet was separated
from your iPhone.

iPhone 13 is loaded with new technologies,

including Cinematic mode,

A15 Bionic
that's faster than the competition,

our most advanced dual-camera system
with sensor-shift OIS,

longer battery life, 5G, and so much more.

With all this,
iPhone 13 still starts

at just $699.

We also have some fantastic offers
from Apple and our partners,

including up to $700 off in the U.S.

when you trade in a qualifying iPhone.

And we're increasing the starting capacity
to 128 gigabytes

for double the storage
and adding a new 512-gigabyte option.

iPhone 13 is impressively powerful.

Let's see it in action.

Now back to Tim.

We are so excited for iPhone 13.

With all of its power and capability,

we can't wait to see
what our customers will do with it,

and we're not done yet.

Our Pro lineup pushes the limits
with our most advanced technologies

for our users
who want the very best iPhone,

best-in-class performance,
best-in-class camera experience,

great durability, larger displays,

and incredible design.

This year,
we build on that in a major way.

Let's take a look
at our most Pro iPhone ever.


This is iPhone 13 Pro.

To tell you more, here's Joz.

iPhone 13 Pro
features our most pro design

with exceptional materials,

like these surgical-grade
stainless steel bands.

Each band goes through
a physical vapor deposition process

to create an Apple-custom finish
that is so elegant,

yet incredibly resistant to abrasion
and corrosion.

iPhone 13 Pro comes
in four striking finishes,

a rich, deep graphite, gorgeous gold,

beautiful silver,
and this all-new sierra blue.

This sierra blue
required an entirely new process,

using multiple layers of nanometer-scale
metallic ceramics applied

across the surface for a stunning
and very durable finish.

iPhone 13 Pro has a newly designed front

with a TrueDepth camera system
that's 20% smaller.

On the back,
you see our incredible new camera system

with beautiful stainless steel trim

that perfectly surrounds
the sapphire crystal lenses

of each of our three new cameras,

and a beautiful textured matte glass
that feels great

and shows off the stunning color.

On the front,
it has our incredible Ceramic Shield

that is tougher
than any smartphone glass.

It also has industry-leading
IP68 water resistance.

On the inside,
it's been completely redesigned

to support our latest pro technologies,

including the all-new camera system,

incredible new display,
and a bigger battery.

iPhone 13 Pro also supports MagSafe
and the ever-expanding ecosystem

of really cool, new accessories.

And it's joined
by the larger iPhone 13 Pro Max.

Now let's talk about performance
and the powerful new A15 Bionic.

As you heard from Hope,
A15 Bionic features a CPU

with two new high-performance cores
and four new high-efficiency cores,

and a faster Neural Engine,
as well as our new ISP,

which provides improved noise reduction
and tone mapping.

And for these Pro models,

A15 Bionic includes
our most powerful graphics ever

with a new 5-core GPU.

It provides up to 50% faster graphics
performance than the leading competition.

In fact, iPhone 13 Pro has
the fastest graphics performance

in any smartphone ever,

great for high-performance gaming

and our most powerful camera features,

like Apple ProRAW
and 4K Dolby Vision video.

And the A15 Bionic chip's new 5-core GPU
and custom display engine combine

with an amazing new display that takes
the iPhone experience even further.

This year, we're proud to introduce
an entirely new Super Retina XDR display.

With a new, more efficient OLED panel,

the display now supports
up to 1000 nits peak outdoor brightness.

That's 25% higher than last year.

And for the first time,
we're bringing ProMotion to iPhone.

With our latest technology,
this ProMotion display can refresh

from as low as 10 hertz
to as high as 120 hertz.

ProMotion is designed to respond
dynamically and match your content.

The advanced, custom architecture produces
fast frame rates when you need them,

and preserves battery life
when you don't.

We also optimized iOS
to take full advantage of this.

For example,
when swiping between apps or scrolling,

the system adapts the frame rates

to precisely match the speed
of the user's finger.

The result is an incredibly responsive
experience that is fast and fluid.

Of course,
ProMotion is also great for apps,

providing more responsive inputs, smoother
graphics, and more precise gameplay.

We brought in a few developers
to see what they could do with it,

and the results were amazing.

Alright, letâ€™s go.

I work on a title
called Marvel: Future Revolution.

I am the Senior Design Evangelist
for Adobe.

I work on Adobe Fresco.

And I am the Founder and CTO
of Super Evil Megacorp.

Catalyst Black is really a rich
and detailed world

and ProMotionâ€™s adaptive
frame rate is really unique.

Because of the 120 frames per second,
you can get perfect response time.

Itâ€™s about the refresh rate,
itâ€™s about the controls.

Itâ€™s almost like your fingers are
glued to the screen

A device like this changes
the game for artists everywhere.

With ProMotion, it means
that Iâ€™m actually seeing

the pixels move in real time.

There is absolutely no lag.

Super Retina XDR display allows

the gamers to see further
into the distance

and catch more details and surroundings.

So we have all these great characters.
They need to look better than real.

The iPhone 13 Pro has

one of the most powerful mobile GPUs
ever created,

and with that, we can really bring

all these graphics features
to the mobile device.

I like that part.

The incredible combination
of A15 Bionic, ProMotion, and 5G

makes the iPhone 13 Pro
the most powerful smartphone in the world,

or any world, for that matter.

The new Super Retina XDR display
with ProMotion comes in two great sizes,

6.1-inch and 6.7-inch.

And the custom-designed OLED panels
work across different lighting conditions

and content types, maintaining
incredible color accuracy and contrast.

Now let's talk about the all-new
iPhone 13 Pro camera system.

This is our biggest camera
advancement ever.

To tell you more about it, here's Louis.


iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max
introduce an all-new camera system,

starting with a new 77-millimeter
telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom,

a new Ultra Wide camera with
auto-focus and a larger f/1.8 aperture

with a 92% improvement in low light,

and a new Wide camera
that has a larger f/1.5 aperture

and 1.9 micron pixels
for our largest sensor ever,

with up to 2.2 times improvement
in low light.

So you'll get beautiful photos
in any situation.

The larger sensor of the Wide offers
more light gathering for less noise

and faster shutter speeds
and even longer brackets

when shooting night mode photos
with a tripod.

The new 77-millimeter telephoto enables
beautiful, classic portraiture photos

and 3X optical zoom for photos and videos

for a total 6X optical zoom range
on iPhone 13 Pro.

With the new Ultra Wide,
low light photos are brighter and sharper

with more details, like you see
in her dress or on the couch.

The Ultra Wide camera also enables
something entirely new on iPhone,

Macro Photography.

Macro Photography typically uses
a special lens

that can focus at close distances.

The new Ultra Wide lens design
and auto-focus system

enable incredibly sharp focus

and can magnify subjects
with a minimum distance of 2 centimeters.

So you can get detailed close ups,

like of this beautiful red daisy,
the cells in this leaf,

or the water droplets on this mushroom.

And for the first time,
all of the cameras,

including the telephoto, have night mode,

which is made possible
by advanced computational photography.

With tight integration between hardware
and software,

our cameras can do even more.

To tell you all about it, here's Rebecca.

When tuning
the iPhone camera system,

we shoot and review thousands of photos.

Analyzing all of those photos allows us
to deliver features,

like Smart HDR 4,

which automatically brings improved color,

contrast, and lighting
for each subject in a group photo,

including for challenging shots like this.

Our software in ISP adjusts
for different lighting,

and we've made improvements
for skin tones,

so everyone looks even better.

We're also introducing a way
to personalize your iPhone camera

with Photographic Styles.

This is a feature that pro photographers
are going to love.

Photographic Styles
bring your individual preferences

right into our advanced image pipeline,

applying local edits
like a photo editor would,

but in real time as we render the photo.

That means you get all the benefits of
our multi-frame image processing pipeline

with the ability to customize it
in a way you could never achieve

with a simple filter.

Select from one of our four default styles
before you shoot.

For example,
Rich Contrast for a bolder look

or Vibrant for a punchier look.

Each uses our deep semantic understanding

to intelligently apply the right amount
of adjustments

to different parts of the photo
while preserving skin tones.

You can also customize the styles further
with tone and warmth,

which combine multiple attributes
for a look that's all your own.

Styles works across scenes
and subject types.

You don't need to set it every time,

so you can define your style
and use it across your photos.

And that's Photographic Styles
coming to iPhone 13 Pro,

and we're excited to bring it
to iPhone 13 as well.

Now back to Joz.

The all-new Pro camera system
combined with the power

of computational photography
will allow users

to capture beautiful images
better than ever before.

The new iPhone 13 Pro camera system

also provides
our most advanced video features.

The all-new camera system,
along with Dolby Vision HDR recording,

produces incredible Pro-level video.

So we asked two-time Academy Award winning
director Kathryn Bigelow

and Oscar-nominated
cinematographer Greig Fraser

to show us what they can do
with the power of iPhone 13 Pro.


Itâ€™s a completely integrated process now.

The iPhone doesnâ€™t require
any ancillary pieces of equipment.

Like, it becomes still,
and she turns slowly.

Itâ€™s the dawning realization.

I thought it was a good challenge.

You know, these are all genres I love.

And itâ€™s so great to kind of parachute in,
do a deep dive with the iPhone.

And with so much accessibility, I think
all pretension tends to disappear.

And so it makes the set and the filming
process much less apprehensive.

There was no limitations to what
I could do with this particular camera.

Whereas normally, everybody gets
so precious about a camera lens.

Itâ€™s so expensive
or itâ€™s so--itâ€™s so fragile.

One of the things that the iPhone
couldnâ€™t do up until now

was to create
an idea of depth from a lens.

With Cinematic mode, whatâ€™s exciting is,
we can actually choose focus later.

To me, thatâ€™s really bringing it up
to the professional film cameras.

We can actually go ahead
and make these stories

and make these films
using the tools on this iPhone.

I believe that with the advent
and with the addition of Cinematic mode,

weâ€™re going to very, very soon
see filmmakers make films

in a different way, which is exciting.

It might even birth
a brand-new genre.

I have no doubt it will.

Just given the size
and given the ability to move this camera.

Exactly.

It will change the language
of cinema in a very positive way.

Everything you just saw,
including the behind the scenes footage,

was shot on iPhone 13 Pro.

With major updates across the Wide,
Ultra Wide, and Telephoto cameras,

it's an incredible device for filmmaking.

The new Ultra Wide camera enables
amazing macro slo-mo videos

thanks to the new lens design.

And the new 3X telephoto allows you
to zoom even closer to the action

and offers a great new focal length
for video.

This is really awesome
when using our all-new Cinematic mode,

which uses machine learning
and disparity to create a depth map

that's built into the video.

So you can change the depth effect,
including the level of bokeh

and where the focus is applied,
even after the capture.

This is another iPhone first,

as iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro are
the only smartphones that can do this.

We also have another Pro video feature
coming later this year,

and that's ProRes video.

ProRes video offers
exceptionally high color fidelity

and more efficient encoding for use in
pro video editing apps like Final Cut Pro.

That's why it's widely used by video
editors as the final delivery format

for commercials, feature films,
and broadcast.

A15 Bionic adds hardware acceleration
for ProRes.

And in combination with our advanced
video encoders and decoders,

as well as our faster file system
and flash storage pipeline,

you can now record up to 4K
at 30 frames per second in ProRes

right in the Camera app.

iPhone 13 Pro is the only smartphone
to provide an end-to-end pro workflow,

allowing you to record and edit
in ProRes or Dolby Vision.

This will transform filmmaking

with a device
that can simply slip into your pocket.

Next, let's talk about battery life.

This is our most Pro iPhone ever
with our fastest performance,

most advanced display,

and most powerful camera system
ever in an iPhone.

Thanks to the efficiency
of the A15 Bionic and iOS 15,

as well a larger battery,

iPhone 13 Pro delivers
incredible all-day battery life.

iPhone 13 Pro lasts more
than one and a half hours longer

in your day than iPhone 12 Pro.

And the iPhone 13 Pro Max will last more
than two and a half hours longer

than the iPhone 12 Pro Max.

That means iPhone 13 Pro Max has
the longest battery life

ever in an iPhone.

The entire iPhone 13 lineup
has been carefully designed

to minimize its impact
on the environment.

We redesigned the packaging
to eliminate the outer plastic wrap,

saving 600 metric tons of plastic.

This brings us closer to our goal
of completely removing plastic

from all of our packaging.

iPhone uses 100% recycled
rare Earth elements in magnets

and 100% recycled tin in the solder
of the main logic board.

So that's iPhone 13 Pro
with our most advanced technologies:

an all-new camera system
with three new cameras,

ProRes video, Cinematic mode,

the new Super Retina XDR display
with ProMotion,

A15 Bionic with 5-core GPU,

5G, MagSafe,

and incredible durability features.

These iPhones push the boundaries
for what's possible in a smartphone.

Even with all this
incredible technology,

iPhone 13 Pro still starts at $999.

And iPhone 13 Pro Max
still starts at $1,099.

We also have amazing offers
from Apple and our partners,

including up to $1,000 off in the U.S.
when you trade in a qualifying iPhone.

And this year, we're introducing
a new 1-terabyte storage option.

This is a great addition
for our Pro iPhone users.

The 1-terabyte joins our 128-, 256-,
and 512-gigabyte storage options.

You can pre-order all four new models
of iPhone 13 family this Friday,

September 17th,

and they will be available
on September 24th.

So here's our new iPhone lineup,

including iPhone 12,

iPhone 11, and iPhone SE,

starting at just $399.

Now back to Tim.

Thank you, Joz, and thank you
to all of today's presenters.
