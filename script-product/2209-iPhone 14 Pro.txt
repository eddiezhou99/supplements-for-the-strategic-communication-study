iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus
have incredible new features

that will help our users
in meaningful ways.

And that's just the first part
of our iPhone story today.

With our Pro models we've introduced
some of our most important technologies

like Face ID, Super Retina display,

and our most advanced camera features
like sensor shift stabilization.

I'm excited to share
our most innovative Pro lineup yet.

To tell you more
about the new iPhone 14 Pro, here's Joz.


Our Pro models feature beautiful

and strong surgical-grade stainless steel,

together with
our industry-leading durability features,

including Ceramic Shield
and water resistance.

They come in four gorgeous colors:

a new Space Black, Silver,

Gold, and this all new Deep Purple.

iPhone 14 Pro introduces
a new front design

that is sure to become iconic.

It starts with the new TrueDepth camera.

We redesigned all components
to fit into a smaller size,

using 30% less area.

We put the proximity sensor
behind the display for the first time.

With this change, we reconsidered
how you interact with your iPhone.

Throughout the day,
you experience different types

of alerts and notifications,

and these are often happening
while you're doing other things

on your iPhone.

So we developed a new experience
that's even better.

Here's Alan to tell you more.

Alan Dye: Our goal was to design a space

that clearly and consistently
surfaces alerts and background activity

in a rich and delightful way,

the result being an entirely new
and intuitive way to interact with iPhone,

one that truly blurs the line
between hardware and software.

We're calling it the Dynamic Island.

We've designed this new space
to be highly adaptive

so it can fluidly expand
into different shapes

using uniquely crafted animations
and transitions.

So now, when you receive an alert,

the Dynamic Island expands to notify you.

Our ambition is to clearly convey
the information

and present content and controls

without distracting from the app
you're in.

This works across the entire system

for things like
confirming your AirPods are connected,

muting, or starting a charge.

Each alert has its own personality,

and it's been designed
with its own unique character,

making it easy to identify at a glance,

like when you're using FaceID,

or tapping your iPhone
in transit locations.

The Dynamic Island also displays
ongoing background activity,

like when you're playing music.

When you swipe to go home,

the Music app gracefully morphs
into the Dynamic Island,

always staying active and visible.

And we've even designed it
to show the current album art.

It's also completely interactive.

You can tap and hold
to expose more options,

or tap to go back to the app.

So now, when you're on a call,

you have easy access to controls
without leaving the app you're using.

We've designed all these animations
to feel fluid, lively,

and highly responsive.

The Dynamic Island is always live
and active,

heightening the sense of vitality

by adapting in real time
to show you important information,

like your next direction from Maps.

And it's always visible
for ongoing activities,

like when you're using the timer.

We've designed Live Activities–
a new feature on the iOS 16 Lock Screen–

to work seamlessly
with the Dynamic Island,

including support for third-party apps,

so you can keep track of what's happening
from anywhere on iPhone,

like following a baseball game
without needing to leave the app you're in

or not missing the Lyft ride
while texting friends.

We've also created a robust design system
for developers,

so every alert looks and feels consistent,
no matter which app it comes from.

And when you have
more than one background activity,

the Dynamic Island playfully adapts,

bubbling out into two elements.

At Apple, we're focused on creating
extraordinary products,

products born from designing
hardware and software together,

so you don't know where one ends
and the other begins.

The Dynamic Island does this
in a truly magical way

and enables
an entirely new iPhone experience.

Back to Joz.

Joz: iPhone 14 Pro has a stunning
new display with Pro features.

This is the most advanced display
we have ever shipped.

iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max
come in two great sizes,

now with even thinner borders,
more active area,

and the Dynamic Island.

It is also brighter.

The new display provides
peak HDR brightness of 1600 nits,

bringing iPhone to the same level
as the Pro Display XDR.

So photos and HDR movies
are gonna look amazing–

including those you shoot on your iPhone.

And for those bright, sunny days,
iPhone can now push brightness even higher

for a peak of 2000 nits.

That's twice as bright as before,

and the highest peak brightness
of any smartphone.

The new Lock Screen in iOS 16
introduces more personalization

with widgets and Live Activities,

so this is the perfect time to introduce

Always-On display.

It's easy to see the time
and other important information

without raising your iPhone
or tapping the display.

This keeps essential information available
for the moments

where all you need is just a glance.

This is made possible
by a number of new technologies

that make the display
incredibly power efficient.

This display can operate
at a refresh rate as low as 1Hz

with a new low power mode,

and we further improved
our LTPO technology,

allowing the display to intelligently dim
the entire Lock Screen.

We also take advantage
of multiple coprocessors in our chip

to refresh the display
using minimal power,

so the time, widgets, and Live Activities
are always available.

And we use our photographic expertise
and powerful image segmentation

to dim wallpaper photos
while preserving skin tones,

so they continue to look great.

And you can keep an eye
on your Live Activities

without even touching your iPhone.

With all these incredible features,

the new Super Retina XDR
is the most advanced display

ever in a smartphone.

iPhone 14 Pro is powered
by our new A16 Bionic chip.

Our newest generation of Apple Silicon
powers every experience on iPhone.

With A16, we focused
on three important areas:

power efficiency, display, and camera.

Delivering incredible performance
with leading power efficiency

is a hallmark of Apple silicon.

A16 has nearly 16 billion transistors,

the most ever in an iPhone.

This is our first chip built
on a state-of-the-art 4-nanometer process,

enabling greater efficiency
while delivering even more performance.

In fact, A16 Bionic is the fastest chip
ever in a smartphone.

The competition is still working
to catch up with the performance of A13

which we first introduced with iPhone 11
three years ago.

The new 6-core CPU of A16
is generations ahead.

It's up to a whopping 40% faster
than the competition.

The CPU uses
our best-in-class fusion architecture

which delivers both leading performance
and leading efficiency.

Our two high-performance cores are faster
and use 20% lower power

compared to A15 Bionic.

And most daily tasks can be handled
by our high-efficiency cores.

At the same performance level,
these new efficiency cores

use one-third the power
of even the best of the efficiency cores

from the competition.

This allows iPhone to deliver
amazing battery life

while still being extremely responsive.

The new 16-core Neural Engine

is capable of nearly 17 trillion
operations per second,

which helps power iPhone's
advanced computational photography.

And the 5-core GPU
has 50% more memory bandwidth–

great for graphic-intensive games.

There's also
an entirely new display engine in A16.

This engine enables the 1Hz refresh rate,
Always-On capability,

higher peak brightness,
and the advanced anti-aliasing

that makes Dynamic Island animations
so incredibly smooth.

A16 also flexes every muscle
for the iPhone 14 Pro camera system.

It uses the CPU, GPU,
Neural Engine, and ISP

to perform up to 4 trillion operations
per photo.

And the image signal processor
was designed to support a new generation

of technology that provides
our most powerful Pro camera system ever.

This empowers every user
to take their best photos and videos–

from the casual user to the professional.

We're excited for iPhone 14 Pro to push
the boundaries for what's possible

and usher in a new era
for iPhone photography.

To tell you more, here's Vitor.

♪ ♪

Vitor Silva: iPhone 14 Pro introduces
a brand-new class of camera to iPhone:

a 48MP camera
with a quad-pixel sensor.

It is our largest sensor yet–

65% larger than the one on iPhone 13 Pro–

features our 2nd-generation
sensor-shift OIS,

and 100% focus pixels.

It also features a new 24mm focal length,

popular in photography

for its versatility
to shoot great landscapes,

group portraits, even single subjects.

The quad-pixel sensor enables
a new flexible approach

which adapts to the photo you're shooting.

For most photos,
we want to optimize for light capture.

So the new sensor groups every four pixels
into one large quad-pixel,

with four times more light.

This further improves light capture

while maintaining
the practical 12MP photo size.

Combined with the new Photonic Engine,

the new Main camera has up to

two times low-light improvement
for photos

compared to iPhone 13 Pro.

Let's take a look at what
the Main camera can do.

You can capture stunning photos
across all lighting conditions.

In this brighter shot,
the Main camera captured

the beautiful, rich color of her skin,

the detail of the fiber in the blanket,

and even a little of her joy.

For this photo, we locked exposure
on the woman's face.

As the vibrant feathers fell,
iPhone kept her in sharp focus

while creating a colorful texture
around her.

In this low-light example,
the Photonic Engine captures

incredible dynamic range,

from the warm glow of her skin,

the color of her eyes,

to every little crease, fold,
and texture in the garment.

The new sensor can optimize for detail
using each pixel individually,

providing more creative options
for shooting and editing in pro workflows.

With this approach we can go beyond
the three fixed lenses

of the Pro camera system,

adding a new 2x Telephoto option
for our users.

We use the middle 12 megapixels
of the new sensor

to deliver a full-resolution photo

and 4K video with optical quality.

This Telephoto has larger pixels
and a faster aperture

than any previous 2x Telephoto camera
on iPhone,

delivering incredible photos and videos.

And it has a familiar focal length
that is great for Portrait mode,

capturing stunning detail
with beautiful bokeh.

We're also using the new sensor
to optimize for detail in ProRAW.

ProRAW merges the best of our
intelligent computational photography

with the benefits of the RAW format,

giving Pro photographers
full creative control

over things like sharpening,
white balance,

and our advanced tone mapping
with more bit depth and dynamic range.

You can now shoot ProRAW
at 48MP resolution,

taking advantage of every pixel
in the Main camera

and unlocking incredible
editing flexibility.

The new sensor has
a different pixel pattern,

so we designed
a new machine learning model

that further enhances detail
and reduces noise.

This leverages the full power
of A16 Bionic

and results in an unprecedented level
of detail.

It's unbelievable how much we can zoom in,

like in this ethereal photo in Hawaii,

revealing each individual rock
on the beach,

and even dry branches from the trees.

With more pixels,
Pro photographers can reframe their photos

while still retaining great resolution.

We are able to keep the sharpness
and warmth of her eyes

as the focal point
of this high-resolution image.

This makes the 48MP Main camera
even more versatile,

further empowering the creativity
of the most Pro users.

iPhone 14 Pro also has
a new Ultra Wide camera,

with a larger sensor, more focus pixels

and–together with the Photonic Engine–

delivers a massive,
up to three times, improvement

in light capture for photos.

The new lens is sharper, with more detail,

so macro gets even better,

like this katydid bug

captured in a split second

to reveal more
than was visible to the naked eye.

The flash was completely redesigned
for a new adaptive behavior

based on the focal length of the photo.

With a new array of nine LEDs,
we control the pattern and intensity.

So it's up to twice as bright,

with up to three times better uniformity

compared to our previous generation.

And with the new Photonic Engine,
all cameras of iPhone 14 Pro

get a dramatic improvement
in low-light performance,

including up to two times better
for the Telephoto camera.

Together with higher-resolution photos
and more creative options,

this is our most powerful Pro camera
system ever.

Now, back to Joz.

iPhone is already the choice
for filmmakers

because of its versatility
and cinema-grade video.

iPhone is the only smartphone
to shoot in ProRes,

and the only device in the world

with an end-to-end workflow
in Dolby Vision HDR.

iPhone 14 Pro also has our new Action mode

for shooting videos
with our best stabilization.

And Cinematic mode gets a great update,

now supporting up to 4K resolution
and 30 frames per second

for even more detail.

Pro filmmakers can also choose to record
in 4K at 24 frames per second–

the cinematic standard.

This is the biggest leap ever
for iPhone camera,

and we are continuing to raise the bar

for our industry-leading video quality.

People count on iPhone throughout the day.

So long battery life
is incredibly important to our users.

Even with industry-leading performance,

new Pro camera system,
and Always-On display,

iPhone 14 Pro delivers
all-day battery life.

So that's iPhone 14 Pro
and iPhone 14 Pro Max.

The Dynamic Island and Always-On display
introduce new ways to experience iPhone.

Powered by the A16 chip

with the new 48MP Main camera,
beautiful new finishes,

Crash Detection
and Emergency SOS via satellite,

this is the best iPhone
we've ever created.

Like iPhone 14,
our Pro models are designed

with features to reduce
their environmental impact.

They use recycled materials,
like gold and rare earth elements,

and meet our high standards
for energy efficiency.

Let's see iPhone 14 Pro in action.

Chin up a little bit.

You are now looking

at the most impressive
iPhone camera system yet.

In a major leap,
the iPhone Pro's Main camera

has a 48MP quad-pixel sensor.

It captures breathtaking detail,
depth, and color,

and now gives you the equivalent
of four pro lenses at the ready.

With every photo,

the quad-pixel sensor captures
four times more information

than ever before.
