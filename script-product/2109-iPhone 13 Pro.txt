Our Pro lineup pushes the limits
with our most advanced technologies

for our users
who want the very best iPhone,

best-in-class performance,
best-in-class camera experience,

great durability, larger displays,

and incredible design.

This year,
we build on that in a major way.

Let's take a look
at our most Pro iPhone ever.


This is iPhone 13 Pro.

To tell you more, here's Joz.

iPhone 13 Pro
features our most pro design

with exceptional materials,

like these surgical-grade
stainless steel bands.

Each band goes through
a physical vapor deposition process

to create an Apple-custom finish
that is so elegant,

yet incredibly resistant to abrasion
and corrosion.

iPhone 13 Pro comes
in four striking finishes,

a rich, deep graphite, gorgeous gold,

beautiful silver,
and this all-new sierra blue.

This sierra blue
required an entirely new process,

using multiple layers of nanometer-scale
metallic ceramics applied

across the surface for a stunning
and very durable finish.

iPhone 13 Pro has a newly designed front

with a TrueDepth camera system
that's 20% smaller.

On the back,
you see our incredible new camera system

with beautiful stainless steel trim

that perfectly surrounds
the sapphire crystal lenses

of each of our three new cameras,

and a beautiful textured matte glass
that feels great

and shows off the stunning color.

On the front,
it has our incredible Ceramic Shield

that is tougher
than any smartphone glass.

It also has industry-leading
IP68 water resistance.

On the inside,
it's been completely redesigned

to support our latest pro technologies,

including the all-new camera system,

incredible new display,
and a bigger battery.

iPhone 13 Pro also supports MagSafe
and the ever-expanding ecosystem

of really cool, new accessories.

And it's joined
by the larger iPhone 13 Pro Max.

Now let's talk about performance
and the powerful new A15 Bionic.

As you heard from Hope,
A15 Bionic features a CPU

with two new high-performance cores
and four new high-efficiency cores,

and a faster Neural Engine,
as well as our new ISP,

which provides improved noise reduction
and tone mapping.

And for these Pro models,

A15 Bionic includes
our most powerful graphics ever

with a new 5-core GPU.

It provides up to 50% faster graphics
performance than the leading competition.

In fact, iPhone 13 Pro has
the fastest graphics performance

in any smartphone ever,

great for high-performance gaming

and our most powerful camera features,

like Apple ProRAW
and 4K Dolby Vision video.

And the A15 Bionic chip's new 5-core GPU
and custom display engine combine

with an amazing new display that takes
the iPhone experience even further.

This year, we're proud to introduce
an entirely new Super Retina XDR display.

With a new, more efficient OLED panel,

the display now supports
up to 1000 nits peak outdoor brightness.

That's 25% higher than last year.

And for the first time,
we're bringing ProMotion to iPhone.

With our latest technology,
this ProMotion display can refresh

from as low as 10 hertz
to as high as 120 hertz.

ProMotion is designed to respond
dynamically and match your content.

The advanced, custom architecture produces
fast frame rates when you need them,

and preserves battery life
when you don't.

We also optimized iOS
to take full advantage of this.

For example,
when swiping between apps or scrolling,

the system adapts the frame rates

to precisely match the speed
of the user's finger.

The result is an incredibly responsive
experience that is fast and fluid.

Of course,
ProMotion is also great for apps,

providing more responsive inputs, smoother
graphics, and more precise gameplay.

We brought in a few developers
to see what they could do with it,

and the results were amazing.

The new Super Retina XDR display
with ProMotion comes in two great sizes,

6.1-inch and 6.7-inch.

And the custom-designed OLED panels
work across different lighting conditions

and content types, maintaining
incredible color accuracy and contrast.

Now let's talk about the all-new
iPhone 13 Pro camera system.

This is our biggest camera
advancement ever.

To tell you more about it, here's Louis.

iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max
introduce an all-new camera system,

starting with a new 77-millimeter
telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom,

a new Ultra Wide camera with
auto-focus and a larger f/1.8 aperture

with a 92% improvement in low light,

and a new Wide camera
that has a larger f/1.5 aperture

and 1.9 micron pixels
for our largest sensor ever,

with up to 2.2 times improvement
in low light.

So you'll get beautiful photos
in any situation.

The larger sensor of the Wide offers
more light gathering for less noise

and faster shutter speeds
and even longer brackets

when shooting night mode photos
with a tripod.

The new 77-millimeter telephoto enables
beautiful, classic portraiture photos

and 3X optical zoom for photos and videos

for a total 6X optical zoom range
on iPhone 13 Pro.

With the new Ultra Wide,
low light photos are brighter and sharper

with more details, like you see
in her dress or on the couch.

The Ultra Wide camera also enables
something entirely new on iPhone,

Macro Photography.

Macro Photography typically uses
a special lens

that can focus at close distances.

The new Ultra Wide lens design
and auto-focus system

enable incredibly sharp focus

and can magnify subjects
with a minimum distance of 2 centimeters.

So you can get detailed close ups,

like of this beautiful red daisy,
the cells in this leaf,

or the water droplets on this mushroom.

And for the first time,
all of the cameras,

including the telephoto, have night mode,

which is made possible
by advanced computational photography.

With tight integration between hardware
and software,

our cameras can do even more.

To tell you all about it, here's Rebecca.

Rebecca: When tuning
the iPhone camera system,

we shoot and review thousands of photos.

Analyzing all of those photos allows us
to deliver features,

like Smart HDR 4,

which automatically brings improved color,

contrast, and lighting
for each subject in a group photo,

including for challenging shots like this.

Our software in ISP adjusts
for different lighting,

and we've made improvements
for skin tones,

so everyone looks even better.

We're also introducing a way
to personalize your iPhone camera

with Photographic Styles.

This is a feature that pro photographers
are going to love.

Photographic Styles
bring your individual preferences

right into our advanced image pipeline,

applying local edits
like a photo editor would,

but in real time as we render the photo.

That means you get all the benefits of
our multi-frame image processing pipeline

with the ability to customize it
in a way you could never achieve

with a simple filter.

Select from one of our four default styles
before you shoot.

For example,
Rich Contrast for a bolder look

or Vibrant for a punchier look.

Each uses our deep semantic understanding

to intelligently apply the right amount
of adjustments

to different parts of the photo
while preserving skin tones.

You can also customize the styles further
with tone and warmth,

which combine multiple attributes
for a look that's all your own.

Styles works across scenes
and subject types.

You don't need to set it every time,

so you can define your style
and use it across your photos.

And that's Photographic Styles
coming to iPhone 13 Pro,

and we're excited to bring it
to iPhone 13 as well.

Now back to Joz.

The all-new Pro camera system
combined with the power

of computational photography
will allow users

to capture beautiful images
better than ever before.

The new iPhone 13 Pro camera system

also provides
our most advanced video features.

The all-new camera system,
along with Dolby Vision HDR recording,

produces incredible Pro-level video.

So we asked two-time Academy Award winning
director Kathryn Bigelow

and Oscar-nominated
cinematographer Greig Fraser

to show us what they can do
with the power of iPhone 13 Pro.

Everything you just saw,
including the behind the scenes footage,

was shot on iPhone 13 Pro.

With major updates across the Wide,
Ultra Wide, and Telephoto cameras,

it's an incredible device for filmmaking.

The new Ultra Wide camera enables
amazing macro slo-mo videos

thanks to the new lens design.

And the new 3X telephoto allows you
to zoom even closer to the action

and offers a great new focal length
for video.

This is really awesome
when using our all-new Cinematic mode,

which uses machine learning
and disparity to create a depth map

that's built into the video.

So you can change the depth effect,
including the level of bokeh

and where the focus is applied,
even after the capture.

This is another iPhone first,

as iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro are
the only smartphones that can do this.

We also have another Pro video feature
coming later this year,

and that's ProRes video.

ProRes video offers
exceptionally high color fidelity

and more efficient encoding for use in
pro video editing apps like Final Cut Pro.

That's why it's widely used by video
editors as the final delivery format

for commercials, feature films,
and broadcast.

A15 Bionic adds hardware acceleration
for ProRes.

And in combination with our advanced
video encoders and decoders,

as well as our faster file system
and flash storage pipeline,

you can now record up to 4K
at 30 frames per second in ProRes

right in the Camera app.

iPhone 13 Pro is the only smartphone
to provide an end-to-end pro workflow,

allowing you to record and edit
in ProRes or Dolby Vision.

This will transform filmmaking

with a device
that can simply slip into your pocket.

Next, let's talk about battery life.

This is our most Pro iPhone ever
with our fastest performance,

most advanced display,

and most powerful camera system
ever in an iPhone.

Thanks to the efficiency
of the A15 Bionic and iOS 15,

as well a larger battery,

iPhone 13 Pro delivers
incredible all-day battery life.

iPhone 13 Pro lasts more
than one and a half hours longer

in your day than iPhone 12 Pro.

And the iPhone 13 Pro Max will last more
than two and a half hours longer

than the iPhone 12 Pro Max.

That means iPhone 13 Pro Max has
the longest battery life

ever in an iPhone.

The entire iPhone 13 lineup
has been carefully designed

to minimize its impact
on the environment.

We redesigned the packaging
to eliminate the outer plastic wrap,

saving 600 metric tons of plastic.

This brings us closer to our goal
of completely removing plastic

from all of our packaging.

iPhone uses 100% recycled
rare Earth elements in magnets

and 100% recycled tin in the solder
of the main logic board.

So that's iPhone 13 Pro
with our most advanced technologies:

an all-new camera system
with three new cameras,

ProRes video, Cinematic mode,

the new Super Retina XDR display
with ProMotion,

A15 Bionic with 5-core GPU,

5G, MagSafe,

and incredible durability features.

These iPhones push the boundaries
for what's possible in a smartphone.

Even with all this
incredible technology,

iPhone 13 Pro still starts at $999.

And iPhone 13 Pro Max
still starts at $1,099.

We also have amazing offers
from Apple and our partners,

including up to $1,000 off in the U.S.
when you trade in a qualifying iPhone.

And this year, we're introducing
a new 1-terabyte storage option.

This is a great addition
for our Pro iPhone users.

The 1-terabyte joins our 128-, 256-,
and 512-gigabyte storage options.

You can pre-order all four new models
of iPhone 13 family this Friday,

September 17th,

and they will be available
on September 24th.

So here's our new iPhone lineup,

including iPhone 12,

iPhone 11, and iPhone SE,

starting at just $399.

Now back to Tim.

Thank you, Joz, and thank you
to all of today's presenters.

What a spectacular set of announcements.

Our most popular iPad is now powered
by the A13 Bionic

with a new 12-megapixel Ultra Wide
front camera with Center Stage.

This is a big upgrade.
