Now, let's turn to AirPods.

Just like Apple Watch,
AirPods have become essential

for so many people.

Whether listening to music on a run

or watching your favorite movie,

AirPods work seamlessly
with Apple Watch and iPhone,

and they provide an incredible audio
and cinematic experience

with the simplicity and convenience
our users love.

In fact, AirPods are the best
and most popular headphones in the world,

and AirPods Pro
have become our most popular model,

featuring exceptional
Active Noise Cancellation

and unrivaled sound quality.

We're excited to introduce
the next generation of AirPods Pro,

our most advanced AirPods yet.


To tell you more about the new
AirPods Pro, here's Mary-Ann.

At the heart of AirPods Pro
is our brand-new H2 chip,

providing an incredible upgrade
to performance from H1

with high bandwidth connectivity
to unlock breakthrough audio experiences

that only Apple silicon can deliver.

The exceptional sound quality of
AirPods Pro is also now transformed

with a new low distortion audio driver

and a custom amplifier to power it.

So whether you are dancing to J Balvin
or relaxing to SZA,

you will hear even more detail and clarity

across a wider range of sound frequencies.

These advances come together
in a magical way with Spatial Audio,

which takes the listening experience
to the next level

by making sound feel like you are on stage

with your favorite band
performing around you.

We are taking this experience even further

with Personalized Spatial Audio.

With iOS 16, you can use
the TrueDepth camera on iPhone

to create a personal profile
for Spatial Audio,

because the way we all perceive sound
is unique

based on the size
and shape of our head and ears.

Personalized Spatial Audio will deliver
the most immersive listening experience

by precisely placing sounds in space
that are tuned just for you.

Another feature our users love
is Active Noise Cancellation,

which has been a game changer.

It reduces unwanted noise,

so you can better hear your favorite song
while on the go.

To create a next-generation experience,
H2 delivers advanced computational audio

previously unable to run
on a device of this size.

This, combined with optimizing
the placement of the acoustic vent

and microphones, now enables
up to double the amount of noise cancelled

over the original AirPods Pro,

delivering even greater focus when you
want to be immersed in the moment.

A great in-ear fit also helps
to provide passive noise reduction.

With a new, extra small ear tip,
even more people can enjoy

and comfortably wear AirPods Pro
throughout the day.


When you want to be connected
to the world around you,

there's Transparency mode.

With the power of H2, we're taking
this experience to the next level

with Adaptive Transparency,

which dynamically reduces
the volume of harsh environmental noise

like heavy construction.

This is made possible because it
processes at 48,000 times per second

to react instantaneously to any
high-decibel noise you are exposed to.


Next, let's talk about how you control
all of these great experiences.

The force sensor on AirPods Pro

brought the capability to play
or pause media

and answer calls
to keep you in the moment.

Today, we're taking that convenience
even further by introducing touch control,

which adds a capacitive sensing layer
so you can adjust volume

with a light swipe up or down.

The new AirPods Pro with H2
are not only more powerful,

they are far more power efficient,

delivering even longer battery life.

Now, you will have up to 6 hours
of listening time from a single charge,

which is a 33% increase
over the original AirPods Pro.

And with the charging case,
you will have up to 30 hours

of total listening time,

which is an increase of 6 hours.

The charging case is also core
to the convenience of AirPods Pro.

Today, Find My can help you
locate AirPods Pro

because each headphone
can individually play a sound.

With the new AirPods Pro,

if you happen to misplace
the charging case,

precision finding will help you
navigate directly to it

with U1 technology.

We have also added a speaker
to the bottom of the case

to help you find it
by playing louder tones.

And the speaker will indicate
pairing, low battery,

and when charging has started.

To make charging easier,
in addition to the Lightning cable,

you can now use your Apple Watch charger

as well as MagSafe
or other Qi-compatible chargers.

And with the addition of a lanyard
loop to the side of the case,

your AirPods Pro
will always be within reach.

These are the breakthrough
2nd generation AirPods Pro

powered by H2,

making our most popular AirPods
even better.

We've built AirPods Pro
with the environment in mind.

All magnets are made
with 100% recycled rare earth elements,

and all outer plastic wrap
from the packaging is removed.

And you can recycle all AirPods models.

Just bring them to your nearest store
or mail them in.

The new AirPods Pro
are available for $249,

and you can order on September 9th.

They're available on September 23rd
with free engraving, including Memoji.

We can't wait for you to experience
the future of AirPods.

Now, back to Tim.
