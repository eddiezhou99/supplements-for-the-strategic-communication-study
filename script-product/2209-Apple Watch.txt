Each year, Apple Watch sets a new standard

for what a smartwatch should be.

And this continuous innovation has made it
the number-one-selling smartwatch

in the world for seven years running.

And we're so excited about what's next.

This is the new Apple Watch Series 8.

It has all of the things you love
about Apple Watch plus even more.

Series 8 is beautifully designed

and packed with the most advanced sensors
and technology.

It features a big, brilliant,
Always-On display with narrow borders

that push the screen right to the edge.

Detailed watch faces
like the new Lunar, Astronomy,

Metropolitan, and Modular look stunning.

And it's so bright that text
and complications are easy to read

even when your wrist is down.

And Series 8 is durable.

It's swim proof,
dust proof, and crack resistant.

To tell you more about Series 8,
here's Deidre.

Series 8 is designed
to keep you connected

to the people and things
that you care about most.

It motivates you to stay active and fit.

With Workouts and Fitness+ there are so
many ways to exercise using Apple Watch.

Series 8 helps keep you safe
with fall detection,

emergency SOS, and Medical ID.

It has sleep tracking,
Cycle Tracking, and Mindfulness

to give you insights into your body
and help you maintain healthy habits.

With best-in-class health sensors
that enable ECG,

irregular rhythm notifications,
and blood oxygen,

it is the ultimate device
for a healthy life.

And now, Series 8 brings
even more features

for health, safety, and connectivity,

starting with an innovative
new temperature sensor

that takes our commitment
to women's health even further.

And here's Sumbul to tell you about it.

Women's health
impacts more than just women.

It also impacts their families
and communities.

And menstrual cycles are key
to a woman's health,

so much so that many physicians
regard them as a vital sign.

We added Cycle Tracking three years ago,

and it has helped tens of millions
gain deeper insights

into their cycles and overall health.

This year, we're introducing a suite
of advanced Cycle Tracking features,

including valuable information about
a critical aspect of women's health:

ovulation.

As always, we build our health features
with two fundamental principles.

First, they're developed
using scientifically validated insights,

and second, privacy is at the core,

designed to keep your data
secure and private.

Utilizing the new temperature sensor
in Apple Watch Series 8,

you can now receive a retrospective
estimate of when you ovulated.

Series 8 has a unique two-sensor design.

There's one temperature sensor
on the back crystal, near your skin,

and another just under the display.

This design improves accuracy
by reducing bias

from the outside environment.

Nighttime wrist temperature
can be a good indicator

of overall body temperature

because while you sleep,
your blood vessels dilate,

increasing blood flow to your limbs.

Overnight, Series 8 samples
your wrist temperature every 5 seconds

and it can detect changes
as small as 0.1° Celsius.

In the Health app,

you'll be able to see nightly shifts
from your baseline temperature,

which can be caused
by things like exercise, jet lag,

alcohol, or illness.

But tracking temperature changes
is even more useful for those who ovulate,

because cyclical patterns can reveal
the biphasic shift.

The biphasic shift is an increase in
body temperature that occurs in response

to changing hormones,
and it can indicate ovulation.

If you're trying to conceive,
knowing if and when you ovulated

can inform your family planning

and conversations
with your health care provider.

Today, the most common way
to track the biphasic shift

is manually with a thermometer
and a journal.

Series 8 makes this much easier
and more convenient

by providing new, automatic
retrospective ovulation estimates.

Further advancing Cycle Tracking,

all users on iOS 16 and watchOS 9
can be now notified

of possible cycle deviations
based on logged cycle data.

You may not realize that common
cycle deviations, like persistent spotting

or prolonged periods, can be symptoms
of serious health conditions

like fibroids, thyroid disorders, or PCOS.

That's why it's so important
to know when they occur.

The temperature sensing capability
on Series 8, plus heart rate,

and logged cycle data come together
to give you a detailed view of your cycle,

all of which can be easily shared
with your healthcare provider

to facilitate more informed conversations.

We believe privacy
is a fundamental human right

and that your health data
is yours and yours alone.

Your Cycle Tracking data is encrypted
on your device

and only accessible with your passcode,
Touch ID, or Face ID.

When using iOS and watchOS
with the default two-factor authentication

and a passcode,

Health app data synced to iCloud
is encrypted end-to-end,

meaning that Apple does not have the key
to decrypt the data

and therefore cannot read it.

Only with your explicit permission
can your health data be shared.

And you have granular control
over the types of data you share

and who you share it with.

Women's health is critically important,

and we're proud to bring these new
advanced cycle tracking capabilities

to Apple Watch Series 8.

Now back to Deidre.

Safety features on Apple Watch,

like fall detection and emergency SOS,
have helped save lives.

There's another emergency situation
you never want to find yourself in,

and that's a car crash.

According to the US Department
of Transportation,

almost half of the worst crashes
occur in rural areas,

and the majority involve
only a single vehicle.

So we built an innovative new feature
to help in situations like this.

Introducing Crash Detection.

Apple Watch Series 8 can detect
if you were in a severe car crash.

When a crash is detected,
it will automatically connect you

with emergency services,

provide your location,
and notify your emergency contacts.

And to tell you more, here's Ron.

In order to detect
the unique forces of a car crash,

we developed two new motion sensors
for Series 8:

an improved 3-axis gyroscope

and a high-g-force accelerometer.

The new accelerometer is capable
of measuring up to 256 g's,

allowing it to detect
the extreme impacts of a crash.

And it samples motion four times faster–
at over 3,000 times a second–

so it can sense
the precise moment of impact.

With these new technologies,

we built an advanced
sensor fusion algorithm

to deliver accurate Crash Detection.

We started by spending years
studying vehicle impacts

at state-of-the-art crash test labs.

We focused on four main types
of severe crashes:

front impact, side impact,

rear-end collision, and rollovers.

In each crash test, we captured data
from the new gyroscope

and accelerometer
as well as from other sensors in Series 8

including the barometer,
microphone, and GPS.

And then we used machine learning
to incorporate all of these signals

into the algorithm,

which was trained on over 1 million hours

of real-world driving and crash data.

Series 8 can detect crashes
in the most popular types of vehicles

like passenger cars,
SUVs, and pickup trucks.

Crash Detection runs only
when you're driving

and processes data only
around the time of a possible crash,

entirely on your device.

That's Crash Detection
on Apple Watch Series 8.

We truly hope you never need it,

but that you will feel a little bit safer
every time you get in the car.

Now, back to Deidre.

Even with the new temperature and
motion sensors working in the background,

Apple Watch Series 8 still has all-day,
18-hour battery life.

But sometimes,
like if you're on a long flight

or without a charger for the night,

you need to preserve battery life.

To help with that,
we're introducing Low Power Mode,

which can give you up to 36 hours
of battery life on a full charge.

Low Power Mode maintains many
of the core features of Apple Watch–

like activity tracking
and fall detection–

while temporarily disabling
other features,

like Always-On display
and auto workout detection,

providing maximum battery savings with
the least impact to the user experience.

Low Power Mode is available on Series 4
and later running watchOS 9.

Cellular models of Series 8
will also support international roaming.

Apple Watch will now be able
to stay connected to your cellular network

while you're traveling abroad.

Simply add your Apple Watch to your iPhone
roaming plan at little or no cost.

By the end of the year,
international roaming will be available

on more than 30 carriers worldwide.

It will be supported on all
cellular models of Apple Watch

from Series 5 onward running watchOS 9.

Apple Watch Series 8 will be available
in four colors of 100% recycled aluminum:

Midnight, Starlight,

Silver, and Product(RED),

and in three stainless steel finishes:
Silver, Gold, and Graphite.

There are also great new colors
across our most popular band styles.

We also have exciting updates
to both Nike bands,

including fresh colors
for the Nike Sport Band

and a new Nike Sport Loop
"Just Do It" woven

right into the textile.

And with watchOS 9,

you can use all Nike watch faces

with any Apple Watch.

There are also two stylish new bands
for Apple Watch Hermès.

"H Diagonal" uses hundreds
of micro-perforations

to create a sporty pattern
of the iconic Hermès H.

And "Gourmette Metal"
features a polished silver chain

wrapping twice around the wrist
for a bold look.

There's also a new
"Hermès Lucky Horse" watch face

that celebrates their equestrian roots.

That's the incredible
new Apple Watch Series 8

with temperature sensing,
retrospective ovulation estimates,

Crash Detection,
and international roaming,

on top of best-in-class health features

like Blood Oxygen,
ECG, and sleep tracking.

It has the latest design that users love
with an edge-to-edge display,

great durability, and fast charging,

and all the new features of watchOS 9.

Apple Watch Series 8 will start
at $399 for GPS

and $499 for cellular.

And with the purchase
of any new Apple Watch,

you'll also get 3 months of Fitness+ free.

You can order today,
and it will be available September 16th.

And that's Apple Watch Series 8.

Now back to Jeff.

I am so incredibly excited about Series 8.

Let's take one more look
at this amazing watch.

So you've taken up running.

Apple Watch has taken up
a few new things as well.

First, it tracked your distance.
Now, it's tracking your stride length.

It learns your favorite route,
then lets you race against yourself.

You're behind.

Yeah, you're behind.

When you're swimming,

it can tell a breaststroke

from a backstroke

from a kickboard.

And when you're done,

it dries itself off.

This isn't a dream.
Your watch can take an ECG.

But if it was a dream,

that watch would track your REM sleep
down to the minute.

It checks your heart rate.

It checks for temperature changes
to estimate when you've ovulated.

It checks out
when you're buying spaghetti.

It could already detect if you fell.

Now the microphone detects
impact noise,

the accelerometer senses
rapid deceleration,

and the barometer measures
a shift in pressure

consistent with an air bag going off.

So it can check if you need help
after a car crash.

And hey, it also shows
your ground contact time.

Amazing.

Have a nice run.

Next, let's talk about Apple Watch SE.

SE has been a huge hit,

and for more than 80% of SE customers

it's their very first Apple Watch.

They love how SE delivers
the core Apple Watch experience

at a more affordable price.

SE is a fantastic way
to get started with Apple Watch.

And this year, it gets even better.

The new SE will be available
in Silver, Midnight, and Starlight–

all in 100% recycled aluminum.

And we've completely redesigned
the back case.

It's now made of nylon
composite materials

that match perfectly
with the three case finishes.

And there's a new production process
that reduces its carbon footprint

by over 80%.

Now, back to Deidre to tell you more.

Deidre: The second generation SE
continues to deliver the core benefits

of Apple Watch that users love,

like workout and activity tracking.

It's swim-proof.

It has high and low heart rate
notifications,

emergency SOS,

and fall detection.

SE also includes the same motion sensors
as Series 8

to support Crash Detection.

And with AirPods, you can listen
to your music anywhere.

The SE display is 30% larger
than that of Series 3.

And SE features the same
S8 System in Package that's in Series 8,

making it up to 20% faster than before.

SE continues to be the perfect Apple Watch
for Family Setup.

With Family Setup, you can use your iPhone
to pair watches for your children

who don't yet have their own iPhones.

Kids can make phone calls and send
messages to contacts that you specify,

connect to emergency services,
and share their location.

And with new features coming soon
like the Home app and home keys in Wallet,

Family Setup allows even more independence
for kids

and more peace of mind for parents.

SE offers everyone
the core features of Apple Watch,

and now includes the faster S8 SiP,

Crash Detection,
new case colors with matching back cases,

and all the new capabilities of watchOS 9,

all at a more affordable price
starting at $249 for GPS

and $299 for cellular.

You can order it today and it will
be available on September 16th.

We are so excited about the great
new features coming to Series 8

and Apple Watch SE, and can't wait
for people to start using them.

But we're not done yet.

Here's Jeff to tell you even more.

Jeff: We've been working
on something completely new.

Over the years,
we've spoken to acclaimed explorers,

accomplished adventurers,
and elite athletes

who are drawn
to some of the most extreme environments–

like Ray Zahab, an extreme explorer

who's crossed some
of the harshest environments on foot,

including the length of the Sahara Desert,

and expeditions across Antarctica
and the Arctic,

and Nadia Aly–
an accomplished diver,

expedition leader
and renowned underwater photographer,

and Scott Jurek–one of the most dominant
ultra-marathon runners in history

and a seven-time winner
of the Western States 100-miler.

Inspired by their stories,

we set out to create an Apple Watch

designed specifically for exploration,
adventure, and endurance,

and it's extraordinary.

This has been years in the making,

and we can't wait to show it to you.


Wanted for hazardous journey...

long months of complete darkness...

Bitter cold,

constant danger,

safe return... doubtful.

Honor and recognition
in case of success.

This is Apple Watch Ultra,

a completely new design reimagined
with extraordinary new capabilities

that expand the ways
you can use Apple Watch.

Every detail has been engineered
to create the most rugged

and capable Apple Watch ever.

It starts with the case,

made from aerospace grade titanium

that strikes the perfect balance
of weight,

durability, and corrosion resistance.

The titanium case extends up to surround
the flat sapphire front crystal,

protecting it from edge impacts
that can occur during extreme activities.

And at the center of the 49mm case
is our biggest, brightest display

ever in Apple Watch,

making it easier to read
in the harshest sunlight.

We also added a new button–
the Action button–

in high-contrast "international orange".

It's customizable and gives users quick
physical control for a range of functions.

The Digital Crown has a larger diameter

and coarser grooves,

and the side button stands proud
of the case,

both designed to be used
while wearing gloves.

And the audio system excels
when you're out in the elements.

We added a second speaker
for increased volume.

Three strategically placed microphones
and advanced software

help ensure voice clarity on calls,
even in windy conditions.

And for maximum connectivity
and communication,

cellular is built
into every Apple Watch Ultra.

Ultra has the biggest battery
of any Apple Watch yet.

It gets up to 36 hours
of battery life on a single charge.

And Apple Watch Ultra can even get
up to 60 hours of battery life

for a multi-day adventure

using a new battery optimization setting

coming later this fall.

And to complement
the rugged utility of the hardware,

we created our most technical face yet:

Wayfinder.

With a host of critical information,
it includes a compass in the dial

and can be customized for the mountain,
ocean, or trail.

And to optimize for evening conditions,
there's Night mode.

Just rotate the Crown,
and the UI turns red

for better visibility in the dark.

Apple Watch Ultra
is designed to push boundaries.

It's a versatile tool for anyone
who appreciates outdoor adventure,

water sports, and endurance training.

And for each of these,
we created a special band

as meticulously crafted
as the watch itself.

With explorers in mind,
we developed the Alpine Loop.

The titanium G-hook securely fastens
through the reinforced top loops.

The band is woven using
an innovative process

that integrates the two layers
without any stitching.

The Ocean Band is molded
in a high-performance elastomer

with a tubular geometry,
allowing it to stretch for a perfect fit,

even over a wetsuit.

The titanium buckle
and adjustable loops

secure the band
during high-speed water sports.

For endurance athletes,
we created the Trail Loop.

The lightweight textile
has increased elasticity

for a comfortable, snug fit.

It's our thinnest band yet,

with a convenient tab
for making quick adjustments.

Ultra is a totally new expression
of Apple Watch.

Whether you're an accomplished athlete
or explorer

or aspire to try exciting new activities,

we think you're gonna love it.

Here's Julz to tell you more.

We set out to make Apple Watch Ultra

the best sport watch out there,

with features for every athlete.

GPS performance is critical
for serious runners and athletes

who want the most accurate metrics.

A typical GPS solution works well
most of the time,

but some environments are really tricky–

like when tall buildings
or dense trees block satellites,

making accurate GPS readings nearly
impossible when training and competing.

The famed Chicago Marathon
is a great example.

It's a notoriously challenging environment
for GPS

because a big portion is run
between skyscrapers.

So we designed a new, precision
dual-frequency GPS solution

that, in addition to L1,

also includes the latest frequency: L5,

plus new, custom positioning algorithms.

In dense urban conditions like this,

Apple Watch Ultra provides
the most accurate GPS

of any sport watch in the market.

We also brought some great workout updates
to watchOS 9

inspired by high-performance athletes,

with new metrics,
views, and experiences

like vertical oscillation,
heart rate zones, and custom workouts.

And now, with the addition
of the Action button on Apple Watch Ultra,

you can make the workout experience
more powerful and more precise.

Press the Action button

for the most accurate start
to your workout.

For triathletes and duathletes, the Action
button lets you instantly transition

from one leg of your race to the next.

And later this year,
we're enabling a new feature

which automatically detects
when you arrive at a running track,

ensuring the most accurate pace
and distance.

The Action button lets you
conveniently mark a segment

with a single press
for the ultimate track-running experience.

For endurance athletes, the bigger
battery makes a big difference.

Of course, you can easily complete
a marathon with battery life to spare.

Using the new low-power workout setting,

most athletes can do a 2.4-mile swim,
plus a 112-mile bike ride,

and then run a marathon

to complete a long-distance triathlon
with full precision GPS and heart rate.

But Ultra is so much more.

It's designed to help you explore
the most extreme and remote locations,

from freezing-cold mountains
at -20° Celsius

to the blazing desert heat
at 55° Celsius,

or 130° Fahrenheit.

When navigating in the backcountry,
a compass is an essential tool.

So we completely redesigned
the Compass app

with new precision views
and added capabilities.

The orienteering view includes
Compass Waypoints to mark a position–

like the location of the trailhead
or your tent–

and they can be quickly added
using the Action button.

And if you get lost or disoriented,

Backtrack uses GPS data
to create a path of where you've been,

so you can easily retrace your steps.

And it turns on automatically in the
background when you go off the grid,

just in case.

Getting help when you need it is critical,

especially in the backcountry.

That's why Apple Watch Ultra has
a built-in 86 decibel siren

that you can activate
using the Action button.

It has a unique sound pattern
that alerts others to your location

up to 600 feet, or 180 meters, away.

Finally, Apple Watch Ultra
has been designed for water sports.

It can withstand the intense
dynamic forces of activities

like kitesurfing and wakeboarding,

and it can go deep below the waves

because we engineered it
to twice the water resistance, WR100.

Using its new built-in depth gauge,
Ultra automatically launches

a new Depth app when submerged

to show current depth, underwater time,
and water temperature.

We also want Ultra to be a great tool
for recreational scuba divers.

So it's been certified to EN 13319,

the internationally recognized standard
for dive computers and gauges.

And we're partnering
with Huish Outdoors

to create an exclusive app
that turns Apple Watch Ultra

into a capable dive computer
for recreational scuba diving

to the depth of 40 meters, or 130 feet.

To tell you more
about this incredible app,

here's Mike Huish, CEO of Huish Outdoors.

Our company is world-renowned

for powering every aspect
of the underwater experience.

And Oceanic has been a leading innovator
in scuba diving for over 50 years,

introducing
some of the very first dive computers.

We're thrilled to announce our new
Oceanic+ app for Apple Watch Ultra.

This is so exciting for anyone
interested in scuba diving

because now the same watch you wear
every day is also your dive computer.

We've designed Oceanic+
with all the key features

for recreational scuba divers
and free divers.

And it works seamlessly
with our iPhone app to plan your dives.

Our dive planner
calculates depth and time,

and integrates dive conditions like tides,

water temperature, and even up-to-date
information from the community,

like visibility and currents.

The best way to experience this
is on a real dive,

so let's get in the water.

Your dive metrics
are all simple and easy to read

on the large, bright display.

Our app runs
the Bühlmann decompression algorithm,

which constantly calculates
and monitors dive parameters.

So from the moment you start a dive,

all critical information
is just a glance away.

And unlike most dive computers,
which require you to perform

a complex sequence of button presses
to find the information you need,

our app uses simple gestures.

Rotate the Digital Crown
to access additional screens

or press the Action button
to set a compass heading.

Oceanic+ provides all of
the safety warnings that you would expect

from the most advanced
dive computers today,

like decompression limits,
excessive ascent rate,

and at the end of your dive,
safety stop guidance

all smartly color-coded
to help make complex information

easy to understand.

Right after the dive, your data–including
your GPS entry and exit location–

automatically syncs to your iPhone
and the cloud,

where you can see
a summary of your dive profile.

And in your logbook,
you can sort and search past dives,

and instantly share your adventures
with family and friends,

as well as the community.

We can't wait for you to try it out
later this fall.

The Oceanic+ app and Apple Watch Ultra
together create a powerful

and easy-to-use dive computer
that will inspire more people

to discover and explore
the underwater world.

Now back to Jeff.

So that's Apple Watch Ultra,

the most rugged
and capable Apple Watch ever.

With a 49mm titanium case,

precision dual-frequency GPS,

a customizable Action button,
long battery life,

a built-in depth gauge,

the biggest and brightest display–
up to 2000 nits–

and all the other great features
of Series 8,

it's designed
to help you run your longest race,

explore the back country,
and dive the world's oceans.

And Apple Watch Ultra,
as well as our entire watch lineup,

was designed with the environment
in mind–

from the use of recycled materials

to suppliers' use of clean energy
during manufacturing.

We're already carbon neutral
for our corporate operations,

and these efforts move us even closer
toward our goal

to become carbon neutral
for our entire product footprint by 2030.

All models of Apple Watch Ultra
will be $799.

You can order it today,

and it will be available starting
on September 23rd.

Here's another look
at the all-new Apple Watch Ultra.

Every explorer has a packing list–

the essential tools

for heading out into the unknown.

We put as many of those tools
on your wrist as we could.

The result...

was the new Apple Watch Ultra.

Ultra's design pushes the boundaries

so you can do the same.

The rugged, yet lightweight, titanium case
extends

to protect the flat sapphire crystal

and can endure temperatures
that fall below zero

or climb 130° above it.

Into the unknown,
you'll want the battery to last for days.

That's why Ultra was built
with a larger battery

for multi-day use on a single charge.

You'll also need a map.

Or better yet, a dual-frequency GPS

with pinpoint accuracy.

The Compass has been redesigned

and now has waypoint marking
and Backtrack,

dropping points along your route
to keep you found

when the conditions leave you lost.

A turn of the Crown engages Night mode,

which removes retina-altering blue light

to ease the strain on your eyes
in the dark.

Beside the bigger, brighter screen

is its most versatile tool–

a customizable Action button.

One push lets you track race segments,

find a way out,

or start up a dive computer,

which is now strapped to your arm,

tracking everything from depth
to water temperature.

The micro-polished sapphire surface
and sealed case

result in an Apple Watch twice
as water resistant

as any Apple Watch to come before it.

And the audio system's three microphones
triangulate

so you can be heard

even in extreme weather.

Of course, none of this matters
if it falls off your wrist.

Which is why we've designed
three new bands–

Alpine, Trail, and Ocean–

for specific environments

and maximum comfort,

to endure long runs,

hard falls, and ripping currents.

Apple Watch Ultra is an essential tool

for essentially anything.

So what will your anything be?

And that's the Apple Watch lineup
for the fall,

with Apple Watch SE providing core
features at an even more affordable price,

Apple Watch Series 8 with Crash Detection,

and a temperature sensor
that enables new women's health features

in a design users love.

And finally, Apple Watch Ultra,

our most rugged, capable Apple Watch yet.

This is our best lineup ever,

and we can't wait
for users to experience them.

And now, back to Tim.
