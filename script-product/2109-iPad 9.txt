There's no other device like iPad,

and today, it's more popular
and more essential than ever.

And the reason it's so popular
is its amazing versatility.

It can transform into
whatever you need it to be.

With advanced displays,
users can literally touch their content,

unlike any other device.

With powerful
and efficient Apple designed chips,

iPad delivers breathtaking
performance all day long.

And with fast connectivity,
advanced cameras,

and accessories like the Magic Keyboard
and Apple Pencil,

iPad becomes even more versatile,

extending what users can do on iPad
and where they can do it.

At the heart of it all is iPadOS

delivering powerful features,

while maintaining the simplicity
of a touch-first experience.

What makes iPad even more versatile
are the over 1 million apps

designed specifically
for its large canvas.

The iPad business has never been stronger.

We've grown by over 40% this past year.

We have a great lineup today

with industry-leading
customer satisfaction,

and it's about to get even stronger.

It starts with our most popular iPad,
which delivers the full iPad experience

at an incredible affordable price.

And today it gets even better.

This is the new iPad,

and to tell you all about it,
here's Melody.

This new iPad is packed full
of updates, so let's jump in.

Under the hood is
a more powerful chip, A13 Bionic.

And it pushes even further
than the speedy A12 from last year's iPad

with 20% faster performance
in every aspect of the chip

from the CPU and GPU
to the Neural Engine.

A13 is leaps ahead of the competition.

In fact, it makes this iPad
up to three times faster

than the best-selling Chromebook

and up to six times faster
than the best-selling Android tablet.

And it means users will see
even more responsive performance

for all the things they love
to do on iPad,

from everyday uses like messaging
and browsing the web

to playing immersive,
high-quality games.

And as users explore more advanced apps
like Adobe Fresco

with its super realistic water colors,

A13 delivers the performance they need
and then some.

And the more powerful Neural Engine in A13

makes next-generation
machine learning experiences

like Live Text in iPadOS 15 even faster.

The upgraded image signal processor in A13

also means the rear camera
captures great photos

with improved autofocus in low light,

and better selfies
from the front camera as well.

Now, the front camera on iPad is essential

for things like remote learning
and connecting with family.

And that's why we're so thrilled
to give it a big upgrade.

It's now a 12 MP Ultra Wide camera
that produces a huge leap in image quality

and enables a super popular feature
from iPad Pro,

and that's Center Stage.

We're bringing
the magical Center Stage experience

from iPad Pro to this new iPad.

Enabled by the Ultra Wide front camera
and the Neural Engine,

Center Stage makes video calls
more engaging

by automatically detecting people
and dynamically adjusting the frame

as they move around
or as more people join in.

It works in landscape orientation
and portrait,

so users can enjoy Center Stage
in all the ways they use iPad.

Not only does Center Stage work
in FaceTime,

it makes video calls more natural
in other popular apps,

like Zoom, BlueJeans, and Webex.

And it's not just
for video conferencing.

Users can record, stream,
and post Center Stage video

in apps like DoubleTake,
Explain Everything, and TikTok.

It makes you more productive on iPad,
and it's simply more fun.

Another new feature coming to this iPad
that users love is True Tone.

It adjusts the display
to the color temperature of a room

to provide a more comfortable
viewing experience.

And by retaining the same popular design,

this iPad supports a vast array
of accessories,

including the thin
and light Smart Keyboard,

and third party keyboards
like Logitech's latest rugged combo

with trackpad for schools.

And of course, this iPad supports
the first-generation Apple Pencil,

where iPadOS makes the experience
of using Apple Pencil

as easy and natural as pen and paper.

And this new iPad will ship
with iPadOS 15,

which is packed
with great new features.

For example,
you can place widgets among your apps,

making important information
available with just a glance.

New multitasking controls make it even
easier to launch and use multiple apps.

Quick Note gives you a fast and easy way
to take notes anywhere.

And the list goes on.

iPadOS is so immensely capable
and so easy to use.

When you combine it
with a beautiful display, great cameras,

broad accessory support,
Gigabit-class LTE,

and all-day battery life,
this iPad delivers enormous value

because this new iPad starts at just $329.

And that's with twice the storage,
starting at 64 gigabytes.

For schools,
it's even more affordable at just $299.

It comes in Space Gray and Silver,
and cellular models are available as well.

You can order the new iPad today,
and it will be available next week.

With the power of A13 Bionic,

a new 12 MP Ultra Wide front camera
with Center Stage,

True Tone, double the storage,
and the versatility of iPadOS 15,

this is a giant upgrade
for our most popular iPad.

Now back to Tim.
