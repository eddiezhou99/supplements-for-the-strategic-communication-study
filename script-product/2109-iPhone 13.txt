iPhone has forever changed the world.

Every single day people rely on iPhone,
from their most demanding tasks,

to capturing the moments of their lives,
streaming their favorite TV shows,

playing their favorite games,

staying up-to-date
with the news of the world,

and connecting with friends
and loved ones.

This is what drives us
to create the best iPhone possible,

to create an experience unlike any other
with legendary ease of use,

beautiful and durable designs,

with water resistance
and great battery life,

with industry leading performance,

and the world's
most advanced camera systems,

and with privacy built in.

People love iPhone.

And we keep making iPhone better,

more powerful, more capable,
and even more fun to use.

Today we are thrilled to introduce
our next generation of iPhone.

Here it is.


This is iPhone 13.

To tell you more, here's Kaiann.

Let's take a closer look
at iPhone 13 starting with design.

It has the sleek,
flat-edged design that people love.

It's also incredibly durable
with our exclusive Ceramic Shield front,

tougher than any smartphone glass,

and has industry leading
IP68 water resistance.

iPhone 13 has a new look
for the advanced dual-camera system

with the lenses arranged diagonally.

The aerospace-grade aluminum frame
is beautifully formed

and really shows off five new colors:

an all-new Pink, Blue, Midnight,
Starlight, and (PRODUCT)RED.

On the front, the TrueDepth camera system
has been reengineered

to provide more display area.

Everything inside, including Face ID,

the most secure facial authentication
in a smartphone,

fits into a space that's 20% smaller.

iPhone 13 is designed
with the environment in mind,

using many recycled materials.

For example, these antenna lines
use upcycled plastic water bottles,

an industry first.

Under the hood, iPhone 13 has
been completely re-architected

to make room for new technologies
and a bigger battery.

This beautiful design is the same
across two sizes,

iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini.

Both feature a more advanced
Super Retina XDR display.

It's 28% brighter, up to 800 nits,

brilliant for viewing
even when you're outside.

For HDR content like photos and videos,

the peak brightness is higher
at 1200 nits.

And you can enjoy
the pixel-precision brightness for longer

thanks to the display's
improved power efficiency.

You'll see true blacks in games,
photos, and videos

with the incredible contrast ratio
of our OLED display.

This new brighter
Super Retina XDR display

delivers an immersive viewing experience

with support for Dolby Vision,
HDR10, and HLG.

Now let's talk about the chip

that powers iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini.

Frankly, the competition
is still playing catch-up to our chips,

not just from last year,
but even from two years ago.

And today,
we're extending our lead with A15 Bionic.

Here's Hope to tell you all about it.

Our silicon is the engine of iPhone.

With A15 Bionic, we have innovations
across the entire system

to deliver more performance
and power efficiency,

At its foundation,
A15 uses five nanometer technology,

which enables us to include
nearly 15 billion transistors.

You'll absolutely fly through demanding
workloads smoothly and efficiently

thanks to a powerful new 6-core CPU

with two high-performance
and four high-efficiency cores.

We've increased the performance

of our CPU's
dedicated machine learning accelerators

that power experiences
such as advanced text-to-speech in Siri

and on-device processing of directions
in Maps.

It's the fastest CPU in any smartphone,

up to 50% faster
than the leading competition,

For graphics-intensive tasks,
like advanced games,

A15 Bionic features our latest 4-core GPU,

enabling more eye-catching visuals
and lighting effects.

It delivers up to 30% faster graphics
versus the leading competition.

And we continue to push the limits
of machine learning

with the new 16-core Neural Engine
that is perfect for ML tasks.

It's capable of an astounding
15.8 trillion operations per second.

We design our Neural Engine together

with our camera hardware
and software teams.

This unique vision and integration
brings to life leading capabilities

in video and image processing.

This means faster ML computations
for experiences

like Live Text with iOS 15.

Point your camera at text on the go
and instantly take action,

like buying tickets or getting directions.

The ML advancements across our entire chip
will empower developers

to do even more in their apps,
like SwingVision,

which can smoothly run
powerful CoreML and AR models

on A15 Bionic for real-time shot tracking,

video analysis, and remote coaching.

PeakVisor helps you navigate the outdoors
to identify mountains

and explore detail-rich 3D maps
while hiking.

And Seek uses a machine learning model
trained by over 20 million photos

to instantly identify plants
and animals around you,

and all the processing is done on-device.

A15 is a powerhouse.

In addition
to core performance improvements,

there's a new display engine,

new video encoder and decoder,

and twice the system cache.

There's nothing in the world
like this chip.

Back to Kaiann.

A15 Bionic also powers
the amazing camera system on iPhone 13.

It combines our powerful cameras,

next-generation image signal processor,

and computational photography to create
our most advanced dual-camera system.

The all-new Wide camera lets you take
stunning shots in any situation,

like this photo full of color and texture.

It gathers 47% more light
for less noise and brighter results

in your photos and videos.

This is enabled by larger,
1.7-micron pixels

that capture more light
and a wide f/1.6 aperture.

It's the biggest sensor we've ever put
in our dual-camera system.

iPhone 12 Pro Max introduced
an amazing advanced technology,

sensor-shift optical image stabilization.

And incredibly, we are bringing this
to iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini.

Here's a low-light photo from
the new Wide camera with sensor-shift OIS.

The larger sensor captures
nearly 50% more light.

Hard to believe this photo was taken
in a dark room

with just a little light
coming through a window.

Night mode shots are even more impressive.

Capture times are shorter, too,
for sharper images of your subjects

and fine details.

We've also custom-designed
a new Ultra Wide camera

that will reveal more of the dark areas
with less noise,

like you see here
in the walls and ceilings.

Capturing fun, creative perspectives
is easy with the Ultra Wide

and now it's even better on iPhone 13.

Now let's switch to video.

iPhone already has
the highest quality video in a smartphone.

And iPhone 13 brings a brand-new feature,

Cinematic mode.

Now over to Johnnie to tell you more.

Filmmakers have
used focus changes

to tell engaging stories for decades.

It's a technique called rack focus

that requires skill, planning,
and creative vision.

You've seen rack focus used
in all your favorite films.

It brings a whole new dimension
to storytelling.

Well, we're bringing this capability
to iPhone

in a simple and intuitive way,

so you can capture cinema-style moments,

even if you aren't
a professional filmmaker.

And guess what,
the movie clip you just saw

was shot on iPhone.

And we'd love to show you more.


It's remarkable and so easy to use.

Just start recording,

and Cinematic mode
will hold focus on the subject

even when they're moving.

Focus transitions happen automatically
in real time,

like from one subject to another.

Cinematic mode anticipates when a subject
is about to enter the frame,

and intelligently racks focus
to them when they do,

And when a subject gazes away
from the camera,

iPhone itself changes focus and then back.

To create these automatic focus changes,

we extensively studied the art
of cinematography

and the creative choices directors
of photography make

to guide the viewers' attention.

We combined these learnings

with computational algorithms

so you can effortlessly create
cinema-grade videos.

For more creative control,
you can tap to shift focus at any time.

Tap again to lock
and track focus on the subject.

Cinematic mode shoots
in Dolby Vision HDR.

This is enabled by our Apple-custom sensor

and the incredible power of A15 Bionic,

which grades each frame in Dolby Vision

live while you are recording.

And that's Cinematic mode.

Now back to Kaiann.

iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini

have advanced new camera systems

with sensor-shift OIS,

fantastic low-light performance,

and Cinematic mode
also on the front TrueDepth camera.

Next, let's turn to 5G.

Millions and millions of iPhone users
are already experiencing 5G every day

for super fast downloads and uploads,
lower latency,

and new experiences on the go.

And on iPhone 13, we've innovated further

on custom-designed antennas
and radio components

that let us add more bands

so iPhone 13 works on 5G
with the latest speeds and in more places.

The world is moving quickly to 5G.

We're collaborating
with more carrier partners

for the best call quality,
performance, coverage, and battery life.

By the end of the year,
we will double 5G support

to over 200 carriers
in 60 countries and regions.

That means you can benefit from 5G
in more places than ever

to binge watch your favorite shows
together using SharePlay on Apple TV+

and even more streaming partners
for video and music.

You can be ultra competitive
in multiplayer games,

share surprise greetings from a celebrity
in high res over Cameo,

or take the sound at any live event
to a whole new level with Mix Halo.

5G is taking over,

and iPhone 13 is ready
with the best 5G experience.

Now let's talk about battery life,

which is really important to our users.

iPhone 13 has a faster chip,

faster 5G speeds, a brighter OLED display,

and the most advanced dual-camera system
ever in an iPhone.

And with all these new capabilities,

the iPhone 13 lineup
has better battery life.

On iPhone 13 mini,
most users will experience

an hour and a half hour longer
in their day than with iPhone 12 mini.

And on iPhone 13,
two and a half hours longer

than iPhone 12
for incredible all-day battery life.

This amazing battery life is delivered
by A15 Bionic,

more power-efficient components,
a bigger battery,

and power optimizations from our deep
hardware and software integration,

like Smart Data Mode,
which intelligently conserves battery life

by automatically shifting your iPhone
to LTE when 5G speeds aren't needed.

We also look at every opportunity
to improve privacy.

With iPhone and iOS,
privacy is built in from the beginning.

With iOS 15,
Siri uses on-device speech recognition,

meaning your Siri audio requests
do not leave your iPhone by default.

Intelligent tracking prevention
now prevents trackers from profiling you

using your IP address.

And mail privacy protection
hides your IP address

and prevents senders from learning
about your mail activity.

Another huge benefit of owning an iPhone
is the vast ecosystem

that extends what iPhone can do.

That includes MagSafe,
which we introduced last fall

and has been a hit.

From multi-chargers
and swiveling charger stands

to cases, wallets, tripods,
and car mounts,

along with our own accessories

for charging,
like the MagSafe Battery Pack.

For iPhone 13, we have leather,
silicone, and clear cases

in stunning new colors

and engineered to work perfectly
with MagSafe.

We also have a new MagSafe Leather Wallet

that supports Find My.

You can now be notified
of the last known location

where your wallet was separated
from your iPhone.

iPhone 13 is loaded with new technologies,

including Cinematic mode,

A15 Bionic
that's faster than the competition,

our most advanced dual-camera system
with sensor-shift OIS,

longer battery life, 5G, and so much more.

With all this,
iPhone 13 still starts

at just $699.

We also have some fantastic offers
from Apple and our partners,

including up to $700 off in the U.S.

when you trade in a qualifying iPhone.

And we're increasing the starting capacity
to 128 gigabytes

for double the storage
and adding a new 512-gigabyte option.

iPhone 13 is impressively powerful.

Let's see it in action.

Now back to Tim.

We are so excited for iPhone 13.

With all of its power and capability,

we can't wait to see
what our customers will do with it,

and we're not done yet.
