People love iPhone and it's
an important part of our daily lives.

We're constantly challenging ourselves
to raise the bar

to make it better and even more loved.

So let's take a look at the new iPhone.

As you can see,
we're going big with iPhone 14,

and even bigger with iPhone 14 Plus.

Here's Kaiann to tell you all about it.

The popular 6.1" size of iPhone 14

is joined by the new,
larger 6.7" size of iPhone 14 Plus.

With a larger display,
you can enjoy more content

when browsing the web.

You can see more text or larger text.

It looks great
with the incredible features of iOS 16,

like the new Lock Screen

and iCloud shared Photo Library.

You can even get more workout details
in the Fitness app

with the new Enhanced Workout Summary.

With a larger display,

you have more area
to watch your favorite show

or play your most intense game.

iPhone 14 also has an updated
internal design

that improves thermal performance, which
is great for staying in the action longer.

Both models have the gorgeous
Super Retina XDR display

with OLED technology that supports
1200 nits peak HDR brightness,

two million-to-one contrast ratio,
and Dolby Vision.

iPhone 14 is designed to last,

so you can count on it to be there
for you.

Both models have Ceramic Shield–

tougher than any smartphone glass–

aerospace grade aluminum,
and water and dust resistance.

They come in five gorgeous colors:
Midnight, Starlight,

a great new shade of blue,
a strikingly elegant purple,

and a truly eye-catching PRODUCT(RED).

Users depend on their iPhone
for so many things,

which is why iPhone 14 delivers
all-day battery life.

iPhone 14 Plus lasts even longer
throughout your day

with the best battery life ever
in an iPhone.

The larger display and best battery life

were previously only available

in our Pro Max models,

and now we're bringing it
to even more people.

Now, let's talk about performance.

iPhone 13 Pro introduced an amazing chip:

the A15 Bionic with a 5-core GPU.

It's a powerhouse that unlocks
extraordinary features

and delivers great power efficiency,
privacy, and security.

Now we are bringing this proven,
Pro-level performance to iPhone 14.

The 5-core GPU is 18% faster,

enabling even smoother graphics
in computationally heavy workloads

like complex gaming.

It has a powerful 6-core CPU
with two high-performance

and four efficiency cores,

and a 16-core Neural Engine

that pushes the limits
of machine learning.

Since its introduction,
A15 continues to be faster

than all the competition
at any price.

A15 is essential to iPhone 14.

And with a custom image signal processor,

A15 also powers innovative features
in the amazing new camera system.

Here's Caron to tell you more.

iPhone is always with you

and ready to quickly and effortlessly
capture your life's moments.

Last year, over three trillion photos
were taken with iPhone!

We develop unique,
state-of-the-art camera technology

while staying true
to the craft of photography.

Lighting is a fundamental part
of getting the best shot possible.

It plays such an important role
in capturing everyday memories

and jaw-dropping moments.

iPhone enables gorgeous photo capture
across the entire range of light–

from bright light,
where colors come alive,

to low light, like indoors,

to nighttime scenes.

And iPhone 14 again sets
the standard for photo

and video capture
regardless of where you are.

It has a new 12MP Main camera
with a larger sensor,

and larger pixels at 1.9 microns.

It has a larger f/1.5 aperture

and sensor-shift OIS

for a powerful Main camera upgrade
and takes stunning shots everywhere.

The faster aperture
allows better motion freezing,

showing off vibrant colors
that bring the scene to life

with great texture and detail.

It delivers a 49% improvement
in low light capture,

for more vibrant color and better results
in challenging lighting environments,

while making Night mode exposure
twice as fast.

And the Ultra Wide camera takes
incredible-looking photos and video,

which is great for wider shots
and unique perspectives.

The front camera enables
great-looking selfies,

high quality video during FaceTime,
and so much more.

iPhone 14 has a new TrueDepth camera.

It has a faster f/1.9 aperture

for a 38% improvement in low light capture
for photos and video.

The new front camera has autofocus
for the first time,

so it can focus clearly
at multiple distances.

Together with TrueDepth capabilities,

the front camera now has a hybrid system

that can focus faster, even in low light.

So you'll get better selfies, group shots
can be in focus from farther away,

and you'll be able to show off
great detail up close.

Low light environments can be
a unique challenge with photography.

We've made incredible progress
in capturing in low light over the years

with increasingly larger sensors
and faster apertures,

more advanced lenses–

all paired with intelligent software

and our powerful Apple silicon that result
in incredible capabilities for low light.

Deep Fusion is a great example.

It's a huge achievement
in computational photography

and uses the powerful Neural Engine

to combine multiple frames
into a single image.

This delivers extraordinary detail

and preserves even the subtlest textures
in these mid- to lower-light environments.

Now, we are taking
our image pipeline further

by applying Deep Fusion much earlier in
the process on uncompressed images.

This retains much more information
and detail,

and enables rendering of more colors
and brighter colors.

This new process unlocks our biggest step
forward yet for low light performance.

We call it Photonic Engine.

This is our enhanced image pipeline

that dramatically improves
low-light photos.

It goes beyond what hardware alone
can provide.

The best part is that it benefits
every camera.

When compared to iPhone 13,

it enables photo low light improvement
up to two times on the front camera,

two times on the Ultra Wide camera,

and two-and-a-half times
on the new Main camera.

You'll get photos
with much better detail and color,

helping you remember
the moment the way you lived it.

There's also a big improvement
to video this year.

iPhone leads the industry
with the highest quality video

and has great stabilization.

It now has a new,
even more advanced stabilization mode

that gives users a powerful tool
when capturing moments on the move.

This is Action mode.

It uses the full sensor with more overscan
and advanced roll correction

to make video look incredibly stable
when you're in middle of the action.

Simply toggle it on
for great-looking, smooth video,

without having to carry extra gear
like a gimbal.

It also supports and Dolby Vision HDR.

The new iPhone 14 camera system
is a huge upgrade,

enabling incredible-looking shots across
the entire range of shooting conditions.

Back to you, Kaiann.

Now let's talk about connectivity.

iPhone has powerful capabilities

that help our users stay in touch
on the go.

This is especially true for 5G,
enabling super fast downloads,

better streaming,
and real-time connectivity.

And momentum for 5G is stronger than ever,

with over 250 carriers around the world
on 5G.

We've also made big improvements
to cellular technologies like eSIM,

making it even easier to connect.

An eSIM is a digital SIM that eliminates
the need for a physical SIM card.

With eSIM, you can quickly transfer
an existing cellular plan

or get a new cellular plan,
all digitally.

You can even store multiple eSIMs
on the same device,

meaning multiple cellular plans
and phone numbers.

And it's more secure.

Someone can't remove
the physical SIM card

if your iPhone is lost or stolen.

eSIM setup is easy.

In just a few simple steps,
users are ready to make calls,

send messages, and browse the web.

You can even do this
without a Wi-Fi connection.

Extensive planning and testing
with carriers

helped enable the iPhone eSIM experience.

This includes the US,
where eSIM support has skyrocketed,

thanks to AT&T,
T-Mobile, Verizon, and many more.

Now, for the first time, all US models
no longer have the SIM tray,

so you don't have to deal
with a physical SIM card anymore.

eSIM provides a simpler way
to activate and use iPhone.

Next, let's talk about some features

that make iPhone even more essential.

iPhone is there when you need it most.

That confidence is especially important
in moments where your safety is at risk.

With iPhone 14,
we have two critical new safety features.

It has Crash Detection–

the same feature you just heard about
on new Apple Watch models.

iPhone 14 has a new,
high dynamic range gyroscope

and a new dual-core accelerometer

that is able to detect up to 256 g's,

and it can automatically notify
emergency services

and emergency contacts
if you are in a severe car crash.

If you have both Apple Watch
and iPhone,

they seamlessly work together
to get you help efficiently.

Now here's Ashley to tell you
about another new safety service

coming to iPhone.

Emergencies don't always
happen when it's convenient.

When you need help,
you need it wherever you are,

even if you don't have Wi-Fi
or cell service.

Now, your iPhone can connect you
with the help you need

when you're off the grid, like this.

Today, we are announcing
a groundbreaking new service for iPhone:

Emergency SOS via satellite.

While iPhone is designed
for a best-in-class cellular experience,

connecting to a satellite presents
an entirely new set of challenges.

Smartphones connect to cell towers
that are a few miles away.

Over the last several decades,

carriers have built
more and more cell towers

to improve the strength and speed
of their network service.

However, there are some places–
like winding back roads

and mountain ridges–
that cell towers don't reach.

Connectivity in these areas can
be provided by communication satellites.

Unlike stationary cell towers,

communication satellites
are hundreds of miles above the Earth,

and flying at over 15,000 miles per hour.

To connect to these satellites,
you need to be outside,

with a clear view of the sky.

And the bandwidth is so limited
that even sending a text message

is a technical challenge.

Typically, the only way to tap
into such a network

is with an expensive device
that uses a bulky external antenna.

We knew that approach
just wouldn't work for iPhone.

So we invented another way.

We designed and built custom components
and specific software

so that iPhone 14 antennas can connect
to satellites' unique frequencies.

That connection is only possible
when the phone is pointing

directly at a satellite.

However, satellites fly too high
to be seen by the human eye.

So we created a unique user experience
that shows you where to point your phone

to establish a connection,
and stay connected as the satellite moves.

This way, no bulky antenna is needed.

Once connected,
you need to send and receive

enough information to get emergency help.

Standard messaging protocols
are not designed

for a satellite's limited bandwidth.

So we created a custom
short text compression algorithm

to reduce the average size of messages
by a factor of three.

Thanks to this algorithm,
it can take less than 15 seconds

to send a message
if you have a clear view of the sky.

In other conditions,
such as light foliage,

it may take a few minutes.

And since each message can take some time,

we knew a standard back-and-forth
conversation

would take far too long
for an emergency situation.

We worked with emergency experts
to surface the questions

they're most likely to ask,

and we provided the most common responses

for you to choose from
with just a few taps.

With fewer messages to write and send,

you can get help quicker.

After your message
is relayed to a ground station,

it needs to reach
the right emergency service provider.

If that emergency service provider
accepts text messages,

we will connect you to them directly.

If they only accept voice calls,
we have set up Relay Centers,

staffed with highly-trained
emergency specialists

ready to get your text and call an
emergency service provider on your behalf.

It took years
to make this vision a reality

through game-changing hardware, software,
and infrastructure innovation.

This breakthrough service can also be used

in more casual, less dire circumstances.

So if you're out on a long hike,
you can use the Find My app

to share your location manually
via satellite.

This lets your loved ones know
where you are,

without you even sending a message.

Now, back to Kaiann.

We believe that this service

is such an essential part
of the iPhone experience

that we'll include it free for two years
with iPhone 14.

It launches in November,
and we're starting with the US and Canada.

Now, let's talk about the environment.

Since 2020, Apple's corporate operations
have been carbon neutral.

To reach our goal
of carbon neutral products by 2030,

we're looking at our environmental impact
across our supply chain

and the entire product lifecycle.

Over 200 of our suppliers have committed

to 100% renewable energy
for Apple production.

Our suppliers work to create less waste
and then reuse, recycle, or compost.

In fiscal year 2021 alone,

iPhone suppliers kept
over 250,000 metric tons of waste

from ending up in a landfill–

that's about one year's worth of waste

from 730,000 households.

We build our products to last.

This durability enabled millions of
trade-ins to find new owners in 2021.

And when it is time to recycle an iPhone,

that has environmental benefits too.

In fact, one metric ton of recovered
main logic boards and cameras

has the same amount of gold and copper
as over 2,000 metric tons of mined rock.

So don't throw away your old iPhone
or leave it sitting in a drawer–

bring it to your nearest store
or mail it in.

Together, we can reduce our impact
on the planet one step at a time.

And that's iPhone 14,

with powerful new cameras,
Photonic Engine,

Action mode,
A15 Bionic with a 5-core GPU,

Emergency SOS via satellite,
Crash Detection,

and the larger 6.7" display size
with the best battery life in an iPhone,

and so much more.

And later this fall, Apple Fitness+
will be available to all iPhone users,

even if they don't yet have
an Apple Watch.

iPhone 14 will start at just $799.

This is the same starting price
as last year's iPhone 13,

but with so much more capability
that sets a new standard for iPhone.

And iPhone 14 Plus starts at just $899,

bringing the larger 6.7" display

and the best battery life
to more people than ever.

We also have incredible offers
from Apple and our partners,

including up to $800 off in the US

when you trade in a qualifying iPhone.

iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus
are available for pre-order

starting on September 9th.

iPhone 14 will be available
on September 16th,

and iPhone 14 Plus will be available
on October 7th.

We're thrilled about iPhone 14.
Let's take a look.

There's simply nothing like iPhone 14.

Now, back to Tim.

iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus
have incredible new features

that will help our users
in meaningful ways.

And that's just the first part
of our iPhone story today.

With our Pro models we've introduced
some of our most important technologies

like Face ID, Super Retina display,

and our most advanced camera features
like sensor shift stabilization.

I'm excited to share
our most innovative Pro lineup yet.


To tell you more
about the new iPhone 14 Pro, here's Joz.


Our Pro models feature beautiful

and strong surgical-grade stainless steel,

together with
our industry-leading durability features,

including Ceramic Shield
and water resistance.

They come in four gorgeous colors:

a new Space Black, Silver,

Gold, and this all new Deep Purple.

iPhone 14 Pro introduces
a new front design

that is sure to become iconic.

It starts with the new TrueDepth camera.

We redesigned all components
to fit into a smaller size,

using 30% less area.

We put the proximity sensor
behind the display for the first time.

With this change, we reconsidered
how you interact with your iPhone.

Throughout the day,
you experience different types

of alerts and notifications,

and these are often happening
while you're doing other things

on your iPhone.

So we developed a new experience
that's even better.

Here's Alan to tell you more.

Alan Dye: Our goal was to design a space

that clearly and consistently
surfaces alerts and background activity

in a rich and delightful way,

the result being an entirely new
and intuitive way to interact with iPhone,

one that truly blurs the line
between hardware and software.

We're calling it the Dynamic Island.

We've designed this new space
to be highly adaptive

so it can fluidly expand
into different shapes

using uniquely crafted animations
and transitions.

So now, when you receive an alert,

the Dynamic Island expands to notify you.

Our ambition is to clearly convey
the information

and present content and controls

without distracting from the app
you're in.

This works across the entire system

for things like
confirming your AirPods are connected,

muting, or starting a charge.

Each alert has its own personality,

and it's been designed
with its own unique character,

making it easy to identify at a glance,

like when you're using FaceID,

or tapping your iPhone
in transit locations.

The Dynamic Island also displays
ongoing background activity,

like when you're playing music.

When you swipe to go home,

the Music app gracefully morphs
into the Dynamic Island,

always staying active and visible.

And we've even designed it
to show the current album art.

It's also completely interactive.

You can tap and hold
to expose more options,

or tap to go back to the app.

So now, when you're on a call,

you have easy access to controls
without leaving the app you're using.

We've designed all these animations
to feel fluid, lively,

and highly responsive.

The Dynamic Island is always live
and active,

heightening the sense of vitality

by adapting in real time
to show you important information,

like your next direction from Maps.

And it's always visible
for ongoing activities,

like when you're using the timer.

We've designed Live Activities–
a new feature on the iOS 16 Lock Screen–

to work seamlessly
with the Dynamic Island,

including support for third-party apps,

so you can keep track of what's happening
from anywhere on iPhone,

like following a baseball game
without needing to leave the app you're in

or not missing the Lyft ride
while texting friends.

We've also created a robust design system
for developers,

so every alert looks and feels consistent,
no matter which app it comes from.

And when you have
more than one background activity,

the Dynamic Island playfully adapts,

bubbling out into two elements.

At Apple, we're focused on creating
extraordinary products,

products born from designing
hardware and software together,

so you don't know where one ends
and the other begins.

The Dynamic Island does this
in a truly magical way

and enables
an entirely new iPhone experience.

Back to Joz.

iPhone 14 Pro has a stunning
new display with Pro features.

This is the most advanced display
we have ever shipped.

iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max
come in two great sizes,

now with even thinner borders,
more active area,

and the Dynamic Island.

It is also brighter.

The new display provides
peak HDR brightness of 1600 nits,

bringing iPhone to the same level
as the Pro Display XDR.

So photos and HDR movies
are gonna look amazing–

including those you shoot on your iPhone.

And for those bright, sunny days,
iPhone can now push brightness even higher

for a peak of 2000 nits.

That's twice as bright as before,

and the highest peak brightness
of any smartphone.

The new Lock Screen in iOS 16
introduces more personalization

with widgets and Live Activities,

so this is the perfect time to introduce

Always-On display.

It's easy to see the time
and other important information

without raising your iPhone
or tapping the display.

This keeps essential information available
for the moments

where all you need is just a glance.

This is made possible
by a number of new technologies

that make the display
incredibly power efficient.

This display can operate
at a refresh rate as low as 1Hz

with a new low power mode,

and we further improved
our LTPO technology,

allowing the display to intelligently dim
the entire Lock Screen.

We also take advantage
of multiple coprocessors in our chip

to refresh the display
using minimal power,

so the time, widgets, and Live Activities
are always available.

And we use our photographic expertise
and powerful image segmentation

to dim wallpaper photos
while preserving skin tones,

so they continue to look great.

And you can keep an eye
on your Live Activities

without even touching your iPhone.

With all these incredible features,

the new Super Retina XDR
is the most advanced display

ever in a smartphone.

iPhone 14 Pro is powered
by our new A16 Bionic chip.

Our newest generation of Apple Silicon
powers every experience on iPhone.

With A16, we focused
on three important areas:

power efficiency, display, and camera.

Delivering incredible performance
with leading power efficiency

is a hallmark of Apple silicon.

A16 has nearly 16 billion transistors,

the most ever in an iPhone.

This is our first chip built
on a state-of-the-art 4-nanometer process,

enabling greater efficiency
while delivering even more performance.

In fact, A16 Bionic is the fastest chip
ever in a smartphone.

The competition is still working
to catch up with the performance of A13

which we first introduced with iPhone 11
three years ago.

The new 6-core CPU of A16
is generations ahead.

It's up to a whopping 40% faster
than the competition.

The CPU uses
our best-in-class fusion architecture

which delivers both leading performance
and leading efficiency.

Our two high-performance cores are faster
and use 20% lower power

compared to A15 Bionic.

And most daily tasks can be handled
by our high-efficiency cores.

At the same performance level,
these new efficiency cores

use one-third the power
of even the best of the efficiency cores

from the competition.

This allows iPhone to deliver
amazing battery life

while still being extremely responsive.

The new 16-core Neural Engine

is capable of nearly 17 trillion
operations per second,

which helps power iPhone's
advanced computational photography.

And the 5-core GPU
has 50% more memory bandwidth–

great for graphic-intensive games.

There's also
an entirely new display engine in A16.

This engine enables the 1Hz refresh rate,
Always-On capability,

higher peak brightness,
and the advanced anti-aliasing

that makes Dynamic Island animations
so incredibly smooth.

A16 also flexes every muscle
for the iPhone 14 Pro camera system.

It uses the CPU, GPU,
Neural Engine, and ISP

to perform up to 4 trillion operations
per photo.

And the image signal processor
was designed to support a new generation

of technology that provides
our most powerful Pro camera system ever.

This empowers every user
to take their best photos and videos–

from the casual user to the professional.

We're excited for iPhone 14 Pro to push
the boundaries for what's possible

and usher in a new era
for iPhone photography.

To tell you more, here's Vitor.

iPhone 14 Pro introduces
a brand-new class of camera to iPhone:

a 48MP camera
with a quad-pixel sensor.

It is our largest sensor yet–

65% larger than the one on iPhone 13 Pro–

features our 2nd-generation
sensor-shift OIS,

and 100% focus pixels.

It also features a new 24mm focal length,

popular in photography

for its versatility
to shoot great landscapes,

group portraits, even single subjects.

The quad-pixel sensor enables
a new flexible approach

which adapts to the photo you're shooting.

For most photos,
we want to optimize for light capture.

So the new sensor groups every four pixels
into one large quad-pixel,

with four times more light.

This further improves light capture

while maintaining
the practical 12MP photo size.

Combined with the new Photonic Engine,

the new Main camera has up to

two times low-light improvement
for photos

compared to iPhone 13 Pro.

Let's take a look at what
the Main camera can do.

You can capture stunning photos
across all lighting conditions.

In this brighter shot,
the Main camera captured

the beautiful, rich color of her skin,

the detail of the fiber in the blanket,

and even a little of her joy.

For this photo, we locked exposure
on the woman's face.

As the vibrant feathers fell,
iPhone kept her in sharp focus

while creating a colorful texture
around her.

In this low-light example,
the Photonic Engine captures

incredible dynamic range,

from the warm glow of her skin,

the color of her eyes,

to every little crease, fold,
and texture in the garment.

The new sensor can optimize for detail
using each pixel individually,

providing more creative options
for shooting and editing in pro workflows.

With this approach we can go beyond
the three fixed lenses

of the Pro camera system,

adding a new 2x Telephoto option
for our users.

We use the middle 12 megapixels
of the new sensor

to deliver a full-resolution photo

and 4K video with optical quality.

This Telephoto has larger pixels
and a faster aperture

than any previous 2x Telephoto camera
on iPhone,

delivering incredible photos and videos.

And it has a familiar focal length
that is great for Portrait mode,

capturing stunning detail
with beautiful bokeh.

We're also using the new sensor
to optimize for detail in ProRAW.

ProRAW merges the best of our
intelligent computational photography

with the benefits of the RAW format,

giving Pro photographers
full creative control

over things like sharpening,
white balance,

and our advanced tone mapping
with more bit depth and dynamic range.

You can now shoot ProRAW
at 48MP resolution,

taking advantage of every pixel
in the Main camera

and unlocking incredible
editing flexibility.

The new sensor has
a different pixel pattern,

so we designed
a new machine learning model

that further enhances detail
and reduces noise.

This leverages the full power
of A16 Bionic

and results in an unprecedented level
of detail.

It's unbelievable how much we can zoom in,

like in this ethereal photo in Hawaii,

revealing each individual rock
on the beach,

and even dry branches from the trees.

With more pixels,
Pro photographers can reframe their photos

while still retaining great resolution.

We are able to keep the sharpness
and warmth of her eyes

as the focal point
of this high-resolution image.

This makes the 48MP Main camera
even more versatile,

further empowering the creativity
of the most Pro users.

iPhone 14 Pro also has
a new Ultra Wide camera,

with a larger sensor, more focus pixels

and–together with the Photonic Engine–

delivers a massive,
up to three times, improvement

in light capture for photos.

The new lens is sharper, with more detail,

so macro gets even better,

like this katydid bug

captured in a split second

to reveal more
than was visible to the naked eye.

The flash was completely redesigned
for a new adaptive behavior

based on the focal length of the photo.

With a new array of nine LEDs,
we control the pattern and intensity.

So it's up to twice as bright,

with up to three times better uniformity

compared to our previous generation.

And with the new Photonic Engine,
all cameras of iPhone 14 Pro

get a dramatic improvement
in low-light performance,

including up to two times better
for the Telephoto camera.

Together with higher-resolution photos
and more creative options,

this is our most powerful Pro camera
system ever.

Now, back to Joz.

iPhone is already the choice
for filmmakers

because of its versatility
and cinema-grade video.

iPhone is the only smartphone
to shoot in ProRes,

and the only device in the world

with an end-to-end workflow
in Dolby Vision HDR.

iPhone 14 Pro also has our new Action mode

for shooting videos
with our best stabilization.

And Cinematic mode gets a great update,

now supporting up to 4K resolution
and 30 frames per second

for even more detail.

Pro filmmakers can also choose to record
in 4K at 24 frames per second–

the cinematic standard.

This is the biggest leap ever
for iPhone camera,

and we are continuing to raise the bar

for our industry-leading video quality.

People count on iPhone throughout the day.

So long battery life
is incredibly important to our users.

Even with industry-leading performance,

new Pro camera system,
and Always-On display,

iPhone 14 Pro delivers
all-day battery life.

So that's iPhone 14 Pro
and iPhone 14 Pro Max.

The Dynamic Island and Always-On display
introduce new ways to experience iPhone.

Powered by the A16 chip

with the new 48MP Main camera,
beautiful new finishes,

Crash Detection
and Emergency SOS via satellite,

this is the best iPhone
we've ever created.

Like iPhone 14,
our Pro models are designed

with features to reduce
their environmental impact.

They use recycled materials,
like gold and rare earth elements,

and meet our high standards
for energy efficiency.

Let's see iPhone 14 Pro in action.


All right, lock it up.
Roll sound, please.

-Lock it up.

It is time to go beyond

what a smartphone can do...

All right, roll camera.

With a massive camera upgrade,

the A16 Bionic chip...

And action.

An entirely new category
of safety innovations,

and never-before-seen
display technology,

this is iPhone 14 Pro.

Cut!

The Always-On display
artfully dims your wallpaper

to create a unique,
low-powered Lock Screen,

making go-to information
available at just a glance.

And introducing
a remarkable innovation,

that is both hardware and software
and something in between:

the Dynamic Island.

An interactive place
that bubbles up alerts,

notifications, and activities,

fluidly transforming itself as needed.


It's an entirely new way
to experience iPhone.


Chin up a little bit.

You are now looking

at the most impressive
iPhone camera system yet.

In a major leap,
the iPhone Pro's Main camera

has a 48MP quad-pixel sensor.

It captures breathtaking detail,
depth, and color,

and now gives you the equivalent
of four pro lenses at the ready.

With every photo,

the quad-pixel sensor captures
four times more information

than ever before.

Then the A16 Bionic,

powering the new Photonic Engine,

analyzes and perfects every pixel

with up to 4 trillion operations

achieving an astonishing new level
of sharpness and detail.

And now, Pro photographers
will now be able to capture

an uncompressed,
48MP ProRAW image,

giving you even more resolution

to rescale, retouch,
and reimagine your photos.

That was perfect.
Let's go again.

Building off iPhone's leap ahead in ProRes
and Dolby Vision video technology...

And action.

iPhone 14 Pro now includes
new Action mode,

allowing gimbal-like stabilization

for all your action scenes.

And Cinematic mode
will be even more powerful

for Pro filmmakers,

with 4K resolution
and 24 frames per second recording.

iPhone 14 Pro is capable of shots

that for most film cameras
are simply impossible.

You can rely on your iPhone every day,

and now it can even help
in emergency situations.

For the first time,

iPhone 14 Pro will be able
to communicate with satellites

with Emergency SOS...

Allowing you to deliver
critical information

to emergency services

in places where Wi-Fi
and cell service are unavailable.

And a feature we hope
you never have to use...

Commencing test.

Crash Detection.

Using a high g-force accelerometer

gyroscope, sensors,
and machine learning algorithms,

iPhone 14 Pro can detect
when there has been a severe car crash

and automatically call
emergency services.


Supercharged
by nearly 16 billion transistors,

the A16 Bionic is the fastest chip
in a smartphone

and powers the most impressive range
of Pro innovations yet.

911. What's your emergency?

The iPhone 14 Pro goes above and beyond,

redefining what a smartphone can be...

Again.


Even with these groundbreaking features,

iPhone 14 Pro still starts at $999,

and iPhone 14 Pro Max at $1099,

with storage options up to 1TB.
