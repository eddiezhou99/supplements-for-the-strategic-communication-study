Next, let's talk about Apple Watch.

Apple Watch is
an indispensable daily companion

that keeps you connected to the people
and things you care about most.

It encourages you to be active
and get more out of your workouts.

And it monitors your health,
helping you live a better day.

I am so inspired by the impact
we've had on people's lives,

and we continue to push the boundaries
of what Apple Watch can do.

To tell you about what's next,
here's Jeff.

Being more active

is one of the best ways to stay healthy.

And it's been at the heart of Apple Watch

since the beginning.

Well, today we're adding new features
to Apple Watch

for everyone who rides a bike.

watchOS 8 will detect when you begin
riding and remind you to start a workout.

And it will automatically pause and resume
if you stop temporarily.

And watchOS 8 adds Fall Detection
to cycling

by sensing the unique motion
and impact of falls while riding a bike.

And Apple Watch
now better supports e-bikes

with an improved workout algorithm
that more accurately calculates calories.

These cycling updates join all
the other great additions in watchOS 8,

like the Mindfulness app
and Memories in Photos.

And this year we focused on
making these features

and everything you do on Watch
bigger and better.

This is the incredible
Apple Watch Series 7.

It takes all the great features
of Apple Watch and combines them

with our largest
and most advanced display ever.

The new Retina display on Series 7 has
nearly 20% more screen area than Series 6.

And it's an even bigger jump over Series 3
with over 50% more screen area.

The Series 7 display
has been completely reengineered

to reduce the borders
to just 1.7 millimeters.

That's 40% thinner than on Series 6.

It's an incredible innovation
that maximizes the screen area

while barely changing the dimensions
of the watch itself.

And the shape of the watch
has also been refined.

Both the case and the display of Series 7
have softer, more rounded corners.

The new display refracts light at
its edges for a subtle wrap around effect,

creating a seamless integration
with the curvature of the case.

And it's also up to 70% brighter indoors
when your wrist is down,

making it even easier
to discreetly check the time.

This new display is an industry first

and we fully optimized the user interface
for it.

Here's Lauren to tell you more.

Lauren: Across the user interface
on Series 7,

buttons have been redesigned and enlarged

to complement the size and shape
of the new display,

like in Stopwatch,

Activity, and Alarms,

making them even easier to tap.

It can also fit nearly 50% more text
onscreen than Series 6.

This helps you read Messages and emails
with a lot less scrolling.

Series 7 also features
new ways to input text.

There's a full keyboard
that you can either tap

or slide from letter to letter
with QuickPath,

which uses machine learning
to predict the word you're typing.

There are also new watch faces
designed specifically for Series 7.

The dynamic Contour face
animates on wrist-raise,

pushing the dial right out to the edge.

And a new Modular face
leverages the extra screen area

with two large,
data-rich center complications.

All of these improvements give Series 7
the best user experience

of any Apple Watch.

We also improved durability,

which is another essential aspect
of Apple Watch.

Series 7 is the most durable Apple Watch
we've ever built.

It has our most crack-resistant
front crystal,

thanks to a stronger
and more robust geometry.

It's also the first Apple Watch
to have IP6X certification,

so you don't have to worry about
wearing it in dusty environments.

And of course, it's still swim-proof
with WR50 water resistance.

With our best-ever durability,

you can take Series 7
anywhere you want to go.

And use it all-day long
with the same, great 18-hour battery life.

Series 7 also has
an improved charging experience.

It charges up to 33% faster than Series 6.

With an updated charging architecture
and new fast-charging USB-C cable,

it takes just 45 minutes
to go from 0 to 80% charge.

And 8 minutes of charging is enough
for 8 hours of Sleep Tracking.

We think customers will love
the optimized user interface,

best-ever durability,
and faster charging of Series 7.

Now back to Jeff.

Series 7 will be available
in five new aluminum colors,

Midnight, Starlight,
Green, Blue, and PRODUCT(RED).

It will also be available in silver,
graphite, and gold stainless steel,

as well as in natural
and space black titanium.

Apple Watch Nike models
feature a new graphic Sport Loop

and Nike Bounce watch face.

And there's a new Apple Watch Hermes
Circuit H leather band with matching face,

plus, an elegant new Double Tour band.

Now, of course, bands are a great way
to customize your Apple Watch

for any activity or occasion,

so we've added new colors
across our most popular styles.

And Series 7 is compatible
with all existing bands.

We've designed Series 7
with the environment in mind.

All aluminum watch cases are made
with 100% recycled metal

and all magnets in Series 7 use 100%
recycled rare earth elements.

So here's our 2021 Apple Watch lineup.

Series 3 remains
at the great entry price of $199.

Apple Watch SE starts at $279.

And Apple Watch Series 7 starts at $399.

Series 7 will be available
later this year,

and we can't wait for you to try it.

Here's another look
at some of the amazing capabilities

of Apple Watch Series 7.

So that's Apple Watch Series 7.

It has the largest
and most advanced display ever,

an optimized UI with new keyboard
and watch faces,

best-ever durability,
fast charging, new colors,

and all the great features
of watchOS 8.

Series 7 is simply
our best Apple Watch yet,

and there's no better way
to stay connected, active, and healthy.
