So let's get started with the

Apple Watch.

Yeah.

We're thrilled by how much the

Apple Watch has grown in such a

short period of time.

I mean to think this category

didn't even exist just a few

years ago, and now Apple Watch

is being embraced by so many

people around the world.

Apple Watch is not only the

number one smart watch in the

world, it's the number one watch

period.

Apple Watch has redefined what a

watch can do for you.

It's the integration of

breakthrough technology and

powerful software and

world-class services that bring

it to life.

For millions of people around

the world, Apple Watch has

become an indispensable part of

their daily lives by helping

them stay connected, to be more

active, and to live a healthier

day.

To tell you how we're going to

take Apple Watch to the next

level, I'd like to invite Jeff.

Jeff.

Wow, thank you, thank you.

We're humbled and inspired by

how Apple Watch has become such

an important and even essential

part of people's lives, and it's

becoming more indispensable in

three areas in particular.

It keeps you connected to the

people and information you care

about with phone calls and

messages and notifications right

on your wrist, and cellular lets

you stay connected with just

your Apple Watch, even if you

leave your phone behind.

Fitness is at the core of Apple

Watch, encouraging you to be

more active by closing your

rings and tracking your

workouts, and now you have

built-in GPS.

It's swim proof, and it even

automatically detects when

you're working out.

And health.

Health has been at the core of

Apple Watch as well.

Apple Watch put heart rate

monitoring right on the wrist,

and while you could always check

your heart rate, Apple Watch now

looks in the background and

notifies you if it detects an

elevated heart rate.

This may seem like a simple

change, but we see this in our

customer letters.

It's a profound change.

Apple Watch has become an

intelligent guardian for your

health.

Today, in each of these areas,

staying connected, living an

active life, and managing your

health we're taking Apple Watch

to the next level.

And now, I'd like to introduce

the next generation of Apple

Watch.

Apple Watch Series 4.

Everything about it has been

redesigned and reengineered.

Every detail has been

thoughtfully considered and it's

just beautiful.

It all starts with a stunning

new display.

We pushed the screens right to

the edges, and we curved the

corners to perfectly match the

shape of the watch.

And the screens are

significantly larger.

In fact, they're over 30 percent

larger.

Thank you.

And we've done this with minimal

changes to the case size.

Series 4 is thinner, so there's

actually less total volume than

in Series 3.

And to take advantage of the new

display, every part of the UI

has been redesigned.

You'll see more in maps and

photo and calendar, and we've

created new complications.

They look beautiful, and they

show even more information and

detail.

And we've also designed a

brand-new watch face with up to

eight complications that really

brings them to life.

And you can customize it with

the things you care about.

Now, you can add loved ones to

your watch face and simply tap

to connect with them.

Or if you're traveling, you can

customize the watch face to

track the different time zones.

Or maybe you want to create the

ultimate health and fitness

watch.

We also redesigned the modular

face with more detailed and

graphical information from apps

like stocks and heart rate and

activity and even apps from our

developers, so now you can track

the live score of your favorite

team with MLB at Bat.

Your boarding information will

appear right on your watch face

with the Quantas app.

Or you can glance at nutritional

intake with the Lifesum app.

Next, the Breathe app has been a

popular way for people to take a

moment to be more mindful, and

now, the app is available as a

watch face, so with a simple

raise of the wrist, the watch

face will guide you through a

deep breath, and there are three

beautiful variations to choose

from.

It's a little hypnotic.

It's kind of wonderful.

In addition, we've created some

dynamic new watch faces that

uniquely interact with the shape

of the display.

With the fire face, see how the

flames subtly illuminate the

ticks of the dial?

And the new water face, notice

how the bubbles splash off the

edges.

And the vapor face, looks

amazing with the rich, vibrant

colors.

We think you're going to love

everything about the new

displays on Series 4.

Next, let's turn to the digital

crown.

The digital crown's been

completely reengineered, and it

now includes haptic feedback,

giving you a more responsive and

mechanical feel.

It's especially great in apps

like Podcast and Calendar where

you precisely flip through each

item.

The speaker has also been

completely redesigned.

It's 50 percent louder, which is

great for phone calls and walkie

talkie or Siri requests.

You ask Siri something on Series

4, and she comes back with

volume.

You just won't believe the sound

you get out of such a small

device.

We moved the microphone on

Series 4 to the opposite side,

as far away from the speaker as

possible to reduce echo, making

phone calls even clearer.

And the back of Series 4 is

absolutely beautiful.

It's made entirely of black

ceramic and sapphire crystal,

and it's not only beautiful,

it's highly functional.

Radio waves can now pass through

both the front and the back,

resulting in improved cellular

reception.

So this, along with a new

speaker and microphone, makes

Series 4 even better for staying

connected.

Series 4 is just as impressive

on the inside.

The brain of Series 4 is our

fourth-generation silicon in

package, or SIP, and we call it

S4, and it allows us to build in

so many capabilities in such a

small device.

S4 contains a powerful new

dual-core 64-bit processor and a

new GPO both custom designed by

our Apple silicon team to

deliver up to two times faster

performance.

On Apple Watch, the

accelerometer and gyroscope,

they power important experiences

like all-day activity tracking

or even identifying your swim

stroke.

Well Series 4 has a next

generation accelerometer and

gyroscope with twice the dynamic

range measuring up to 32 G

forces and can sample motion

data eight times faster.

You probably have no idea what

any of that means, but that's

okay because we do, and it's

allowed us to do something new.

One of the leading causes of

injuries worldwide is falls.

So whether your slip off a step

ladder or you trip on a curb, a

hard fall can be serious, and it

can be difficult to get

immediate help.

Well now Apple Watch Series 4

can detect a fall.

It's interesting, identifying a

fall may sound like a

straightforward problem, but it

requires a tremendous amount of

data and analysis.

We conducted studies with

thousands of people over a long

period of time, and we captured

data on real-world falls, and we

learned something.

We learned that with falls

there's this repeatable motion

pattern that happens.

For example, when you trip, your

body will naturally pitch

forward, and your arms will go

out involuntarily to brace

yourself.

However, if you slip, there's a

natural upward motion of the

arms.

Well these are motions Series 4

is ideally suited to recognize.

With the new accelerometer and

gyroscope, the watch analyzes

wrist trajectory and impact

acceleration to determine when a

fall occurs, and after detecting

a fall, Series 4 delivers an

alert, and from that alert, you

can initiate an emergency call.

However, if the watch senses you

are immobile for one minute, it

will start the call

automatically.

And it also sends a message with

your location to your emergency

contacts using the SOS feature

that is already built into Apple

Watch.

Fall detection is a feature that

we hope you never need, but it's

really nice to know it's there.

The optical heart sensor has

been essential to Apple Watch

from the beginning, and it

allows us to calculate the

calorie burned during your

workouts.

It allows to determine your

resting heart rate, and it also

powers the high heart rate

notification that's helped Apple

Watch become an intelligent

guardian for your health.

We wanted to do even more in

this space, and so we're

announcing three new heart

features.

First, a notification if your

heart rate appears to be too

low.

Now generally a low heart rate

is thought to be a good thing,

but if it's too low, it might

mean that your heart's not

pumping enough blood to the

body, and that can be a sign of

something serious, and now Apple

Watch can detect it.

The second feature is related to

heart rhythm, and this is a big

deal.

Apple Watch can now screen your

heart rhythm in the background,

and it sends you a notification

if it detects an irregular

rhythm that appears to be atrial

fibrillation.

Now, it won't catch every

instance of AFib, but we believe

this is going to help a lot of

people who didn't otherwise know

they had an issue.

The first two features, they're

powered by the optical sensor.

The third feature is made

possible by a new electrical

heart sensor on Series 4.

We've added electrodes into the

back sapphire crystal and the

digital crown allowing you take

an electrocardiogram.

It's otherwise known as an ECG,

and this is the first ECG

product offered over the counter

directly to consumers.

An ECG measures the electrical

activity of the heartbeat, and

it's used by physicians to help

diagnosis certain heart diseases

and other conditions.

And so now you can take an ECG

anytime, anywhere, right from

your wrist.

You just open the app, and you

put your finger on the digital

crown.

To show you how this works,

let's take a closer look.

The built-in electrodes in the

back crystal and the digital

crown, they detect electrical

impulses from the heartbeat.

They route them to the S4 chip,

which converts them to signal

for our algorithms.

The entire process takes just 30

seconds, and at the completion

of the ECG recording, you will

receive a heart rhythm

classification.

If your heart is beating in a

normal rhythm, the app will

classify the measurement as

sinus rhythm, and the app will

also classify atrial

fibrillation.

All ECG recordings, their

classifications, the noted

symptoms, they're all stored

right in the health app in a PDF

you can share with your doctor.

So now your doctor has a

detailed picture of your heart

rhythm, similar to a lead one

ECG that is usually only

obtained in the clinic.

And to give you his thoughts on

this, I'd like to invite to the

stage the president of the

American Heart Association, and

also a practicing cardiologist,

Dr. Ivor Benjamin.

Thank you, Jeff.

I'm inspired by the life-saving

potential of technology and

applaud Apple's innovation and

commitment to health.

Capturing meaningful data about

a person's heart in real time is

changing the way we practice

medicine.

In my experience, people often

report symptoms that are absent

during their medical visits.

That is why information is

vital, information about a

person's daily lifestyle choices

and their specific health data.

The ability to access health

data on on-demand

electrocardiogram or ECG is game

changing.

Especially when evaluating

atrial fibrillation and

irregular and often rapid heart

rate that can increase a

person's risk of stroke, heart

failure, and other

health-related complications.

At the American Heart

Association, we are committed to

educate and empower people, to

be proactive in all areas of

their health and general

well-being.

The American Heart Association

is a relentless force for a

world of longer, healthier

lives.

Products that seek to provide

deeper health insights like the

Apple Watch Series 4 offer great

potential in getting us there.

Thank you.

Back to you Jeff.

Thanks Dr. Benjamin.

It's great to have the support

of the American Heart

Association, and I'm also

pleased to say, we've received

clearance from the FDA.

And this is a de novo clearance,

which means it's the first of

its kind.

Also, the irregular heart rhythm

alert has also received FDA

clearance.

Both of these features will be

available to U.S. customers

later this year, and we're

working hard to bring them to

customers around the world.

I just have to show you when you

open the app, this is what you

see on the watch face.

It's really beautiful.

People in general don't like

things that are medical.

This kind of makes you want to

take an ECG.

It's amazing to think that the

same watch you wear every day to

make phone calls and respond to

messages, track your activity,

like even run a marathon can now

take an ECG.

Apple Watch Series 4 is the

ultimate guardian for your

health, the best fitness

companion, and the most

convenient way to stay

connected.

And with all these amazing

features, of course, your data

is still protected.

At Apple we believe your

personal information belongs to

you, you should decide who you

share it with, and who gets to

see it, period.

All your health and fitness

data, it's encrypted on device

and in cloud.

So Apple Watch Series 4, larger

display, brand new UI, digital

crown with haptics, up to two

times faster performance, a

louder speaker, fall detection,

and an industry first built-in

electrical heart sensor capable

of taking an ECG and of course

cellular, GPS, altimeter, swim

proof, and I probably missed

some things.

We also have the most advanced

wearable operating system watch

OS5.

So with all of these features in

a slimmer design, you're

probably wondering about battery

life.

Well, I'm pleased to tell you

that Series 4 has the same

18-hour, all-day battery life

that our customers enjoy on

Apple Watch.

And we've increased the outdoor

workout time to six hours, so

you can have full GPS tracking,

which is perfect for those

marathons or long bike rides.

And of course, Apple Watch has

been designed and manufactured

in an environmentally friendly

way.

We created a video about Series

4, and I'd like to show that to

you now.

Apple Watch Series 4 is more

than an evolution.

It represents a fundamental

redesign and reengineering of

Apple Watch.

While retaining the iconic

design, we've developed and

refined the form, also managing

to make it thinner.

The new display is now over 30

percent larger and is seamlessly

integrated into the product.

The interface has been

redesigned for our new display,

providing more information with

richer detail.

The hardware and the software

combine to define a very new and

truly integrated singular

design.

Navigating with the digital

crown, already one of the most

intricate mechanisms we've ever

created, has been entirely

reengineered with haptic

feedback delivering a precise

mechanical feel as you scroll.

In addition to an optical heart

sensor, there is a new

Apple-designed electrical heart

sensor that allows you to take

an electrocardiogram or ECG to

share with your doctor, a

momentous achievement for a

wearable device.

Placing a finger on the digital

crown creates a closed circuit

with electrodes on the back,

providing data the ECG app uses

to analyze your heart rhythm.

While understanding heart health

is essential to our well-being,

additional features and

enhancements encourage us to

live an overall healthier, more

active life.

The accelerometer, gyroscope,

and altimeter allow you to

record new types of workouts,

measure runs with increased

precision, and track your

all-day activity with great

accuracy.

Enhanced cellular connectivity

enables something truly

liberating, the ability to stay

connected with just your watch.

Phone calls, music streaming,

and even emergency assistance

are all immediately available

from your wrist.

Apple Watch Series 4 is a device

so powerful, so personal, so

liberating, it can change the

way you live each day.

Series 4 will be available in

three aluminum finishes, silver,

gold, and space gray, and the

stainless collection is

absolutely beautiful with

polished and space black.

We've shipped stainless before,

but there's something about

Series 4 that is even more

gorgeous, and there's a

brand-new finish, gold

stainless, which is wonderful

paired with this Milanese loop.

All band colors and band styles

fit any generation of Apple

Watch, so all those Series 4

customers, all the bands that

you already own will work just

fine on the Series 4.

For customers who love Nike

Plus, especially runners, it's

been optimized for Series 4 with

full-screen watch faces that

look great, and they've done

something really cool with the

Nike sport loop.

They've added reflective yarn

for night-time visibility.

Apple Watch Hermes continues

this Fall with some bold new

looks.

There's these gorgeous color

blocks on the watch face, and

they change with the passage of

time, and they look really

wonderful paired with the new

Double Tour bands.

Apple Watch Series 4 with GPS

starts at $399.

Series 4 with cellular starts at

$499, and we're keeping Series 3

in the line at more affordable

prices, starting at just $279.

Series 4 GPS will be available

in 26 markets at launch.

Series 4 with cellular will

start in 16 markets with 34

carriers, that's more than twice

the number of carriers we had

last year.

You can order Series 4 starting

Friday, and it will be available

the following Friday, September

21st.

Series 3 at the new prices is

available right after the show,

and watchOS 5, the most advanced

wearable operating system will

be available on September 17.

That's Apple Watch, and now back

to Tim.
