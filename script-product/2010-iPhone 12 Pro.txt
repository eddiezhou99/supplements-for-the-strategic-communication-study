We want to take it even further
with our pro line of iPhones.

And here they are.

This is iPhone 12 Pro.

I'd like to hand it over to Joz
to tell you all about it.

iPhone 12 Pro is designed

for our users who want
the absolute most from their iPhone.

It takes our new design even further
with premium materials.

This includes a durable and beautiful
surgical-grade stainless steel band

and precision-milled back glass.

They come in four new finishes,
including an elegant silver,

a rich, deep graphite, a stunning gold

and an all-new Pacific Blue.

They're engineered
with an advanced PVD process

that provides a spectacular luster.

And our new gold uses a high-power
magnetron coating process

that gives the stainless steel
a stunning bright gold finish.

The pro models also feature
our incredibly durable Ceramic Shield.

And these models have best-in-class
water and dust resistance

with an IP68 rating,

so they can withstand submersion
at up to six meters for 30 minutes.

The pro design is complemented beautifully
with our new MagSafe accessories

which provide easy and secure attachment
and high-power charging.

iPhone 12 Pro features

our industry-leading
Super Retina XDR displays.

We were able to go from today's 5.8-inch
to a much larger 6.1-inch display.

And iPhone 12 Pro Max increases
from today's 6.5-inch

to a more expansive 6.7-inch display.

We were able to grow these displays

but keep the form factors
nearly identical.

So for people who want
our biggest displays,

this is the largest display ever
in an iPhone,

with our highest resolution,

featuring nearly
three and a half million pixels.

HDR video comes to life.

High-resolution HDR movies and TV shows
that you stream over 5G

will look amazing.

Our pro models are packed
with pro-level performance.

While our competition is scrambling
to catch up with our chips from last year,

we remain generations ahead.

And our advantages
go beyond the CPU and GPU.

Together with our Image Signal Processor,
or ISP,

they enable powerful computational
photography for camera experiences

that simply are not possible
with traditional cameras.

For example, Deep Fusion uses
machine learning on the Neural Engine

for pixel-by-pixel processing of photos

with unprecedented detail, texture
and minimal noise.

To accomplish this, Deep Fusion uses
all the compute engines of the A14.

Our camera sensor captures multiple images

and processes them through the ISP.

The CPU computes
the alignment of the frames.

The GPU pre-processes the images

before running them through
the Neural Engine.

And then there's additional
post-processing done in the GPU.

With A14 Bionic, we are able to bring
Deep Fusion to all four cameras

of iPhone 12 Pro,

including the front-facing
TrueDepth camera.

We combine state-of-the-art
camera hardware

with this amazing compute power

to create a pro camera system
that is unlike any other device.

iPhone 12 Pro features
our amazing Ultra Wide camera

with a 120-degree field of view,

and our new Wide camera
with faster f/1.6 aperture

and 7-element lens
that lets in 27% more light.

iPhone 12 Pro also features a 52 mm
Telephoto camera for stunning portraits.

So iPhone 12 Pro delivers
high-quality optical images

at three different focal lengths,

with a 4x optical zoom range.

The larger size of the iPhone 12 Pro Max

provided us with an opportunity to do
even more with our pro camera system.

And here's Andrew
to tell you all about it.

In iPhone 12 Pro Max, we've been able
to create our best camera ever.

We have a brand-new Telephoto camera
with a 65 mm focal length.

Moving from a 52 mm focal length
to a 65 mm

allows for longer framing
in the classic portrait style.

With the new Telephoto, you can now
optically zoom in two and a half times

for even closer shots or tighter crops,

which means improving
to a 5x optical zoom range

from the Ultra Wide's 13 mm
to the Telephoto's 65 mm.

iPhone 12 Pro Max features
an all-new massive Wide camera

with an f/1.6 aperture, a new sensor

and new system for
Optical Image Stabilization, or OIS.

Let me first tell you
about the new sensor.

It's 47% larger,
with 1.7 micron pixels, our largest yet.

Larger pixels plus a faster aperture

gives iPhone 12 Pro Max

an incredible 87% improvement
in low light,

which is our biggest leap
in light gathering capability.

On top of that,
we developed a completely new system

for optical image stabilization

that adopts a high-end DSLR approach
called sensor-shift.

Sensor-shift applies stabilization
to the sensor

instead of the heavier lens

to precisely control motion in X and Y
while maintaining sharpness.

This cancels both low
and high-frequency disturbances

like hand movement or vibrations in a car.

In addition, the OIS
on all our Wide cameras this year

can now make 5,000
micro adjustments per second,

which is five times more than last year.

Along with motion processing advancements,

we get stabilized exposure times
of up to two seconds in low light

for handheld shots,

equal to a full f-stop increase
in light gathering.

This sensor-shift system
is unique to Apple

and helps people capture
everyday situations

with extraordinary images.

And it delivers steady video
with a truly cinematic feel.

Now here's my colleague Alok
to tell you more about another feature

we created for our pro users.

These are amazing cameras for pros,

and we want
to give our pros even more control

over the images they capture.

Many pros love to capture in RAW,

but they're missing the benefit
of our sophisticated image fusion.

So we'd like to show you a sneak peek
of a new feature

that combines the control
of shooting in RAW

with the power
of our computational photography.

And that's Apple ProRAW.

This will be
an incredible feature for pros

and will be available
in the iPhone Camera app

on iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max
later this year.

It provides many of the benefits
of our multi-frame image processing

and computational photography,

like Deep Fusion and Smart HDR,

and combines them with the depth
and flexibility of a RAW format.

In order to achieve this,
we constructed a new pipeline

that takes components of the processing

we do in our CPU, GPU, ISP
and Neural Engine

and combines them
into a new Deep Image file

computed at the time of capture
without any shutter delay.

And we do this for all four cameras,

dynamically adapting for various scenes

while maintaining
our intuitive camera experience.

Things like sharpening, white balance
and tone mapping

become instructions
rather than being baked into the photo,

delivering full creative control
over color, detail and dynamic range.

Here you can see a photo
shot with Apple ProRAW.

Notice how it's taken full advantage
of Deep Fusion

to capture a wide range of light
and shadow from multiple exposures.

Because all the data is contained
in Apple ProRAW,

this image can be processed
in various ways

while retaining the crisp,
beautifully rendered detail.

You can edit Apple ProRAW
directly in our Photos app

and other professional photo editing apps.

We're also creating an API
for third-party apps

to capture images in Apple ProRAW.

This is really the best of both worlds.

The flexibility of RAW with the power
of Apple's computational photography.

And now, back to Joz.

iPhone 12 Pro allows you
to take absolutely stunning photos.

Even at dusk, you can see the incredible
color and texture in the shadows.

You can see this Ultra Wide shot
preserves the detail

in the cracks of the desert floor.

You can almost feel it.

With Deep Fusion,
you can even see the detail of her dress

in this low-light setting.

In this classic black-and-white,

you can feel the sun glistening
on the horse.

On a tripod,
we can take Night mode even further,

capturing the pop of color in the tent
as well as the stars in the night sky.

Now let's talk about pro video.

Year after year,

iPhone provides the highest quality video
on a smartphone.

Pros use iPhone to shoot TV shows,
news reports and even movies.

This has never been more important,
as our homes have become our studios.

In fact, for many TV productions,
from American Idol to Mythic Quest,

the show has been able to go on
because of iPhone.

This year, we're taking pro video further,
much further.

For the first time, we're bringing
HDR video recording to iPhone.

You can now record
in 10-bit High Dynamic Range.

This means we can capture
over 700 million colors.

That's 60 times more colors than before.

While you capture,
you get a live preview of your HDR content

on the Super Retina XDR display.

And we're also gonna do something
that no other device in the world can do.

iPhone 12 Pro is the first camera

to record in Dolby Vision HDR.

To accomplish this,
every single frame of 10-bit video

runs through our ISP,
generating a histogram

and allowing iPhone
to grade each frame in Dolby Vision,

live while you're recording.

And we can do this at 4K resolution
and 60 frames per second.

This is enabled by our Apple custom sensor

and the incredible power of the A14,

which does the intense processing
of these image algorithms in real time.

Prior to today, you needed
a pro studio lab and special equipment

to edit your original Dolby Vision footage
and then re-encode your files.

iPhone 12 Pro will be the first device
to edit in Dolby Vision,

right from the Photos app.

You can even apply filters.

iPhone will regenerate
the Dolby Vision tuning on the fly.

Oscar-winning cinematographer
Emmanuel "Chivo" Lubezki made a film

to showcase iPhone 12 Pro
with Dolby Vision,

and I'd like to show it to you now.

My name is Emmanuel Lubezki.
I am a cinematographer.

When I started shooting movies,
you had to rent a very expensive camera,

buy film stock, pay for developing,

special equipment for editing.

Now, you can really go out with
one of these devices and make a movie.

The iPhone Pro will allow filmmakers
all around the world to make films

that otherwise are impossible
because you don't have the means

or because the cameras are too heavy
or too complicated.

I think the next great cinematographer
or the next great film director

is already making movies
with one of these devices.

So iPhone is the first and only device

that enables you to capture, edit,
watch and share Dolby Vision video.

What an incredible
end-to-end pro video workflow,

right from your pocket.

And with 5G, sharing your videos
from the field has never been faster.

And we have another exciting capability
we're bringing to our new pro iPhones.

Here's Francesca to tell you more.

We've pushed the industry
with depth technology over the years,

and today we continue
that innovation with...

a LiDAR scanner.

LiDAR stands
for Light Detection and Ranging,

and it measures how long it takes light
to reach an object and reflect back.

We've adopted this technology for iPhone,

and with the machine learning
and depth frameworks of iOS 14,

iPhone understands the world around you

and builds a precise depth map
of the scene.

It enables object and room scanning,
photo and video effects

and precise placement of AR objects.

LiDAR makes iPhone 12 Pro
a powerful device

for delivering instant AR and
unlocking endless opportunities in apps.

The LiDAR scanner also takes
our pro camera system

to a whole new level.

With LiDAR's ability to see in the dark,

we use it for autofocus
in low-light scenes,

improving accuracy to focus
and reducing capture time.

Instead of hunting for focus,

the LiDAR scanner
can identify the subject,

focus and capture right away.

This works in photos and videos.

In fact, with LiDAR, we can improve
focus time in low-light scenes

by up to six times,

so your subject is clearly in focus,
without missing the moment.

LiDAR also improves depth
in low light for Night mode,

enabling stunning
Night mode portrait shots like this one.

Look at the incredible detail in the face,

the realistic color throughout the scene

and the blooming bokeh
in the lights in the background.

And that's the new LiDAR scanner
on iPhone 12 Pro.

Now back to Joz.

As you can see, iPhone 12 Pro
is loaded with incredible innovations.

And when you combine
these advanced capabilities with 5G,

it will enable you to do
so much more on the go.

And 5G is going to unlock even more
opportunities for our developers.

I'd like to show you a couple examples.

On-call physicians often need to review
complex medical scans anywhere, anytime.

OsiriX HD app and 5G enables them
to download these very large images

with lightning-fast speeds.

The ability to download
a full diagnostic scan

in a matter of seconds versus minutes

can make the difference between
life and death for a stroke victim.

And enterprise will be able to use
private 5G networks

for high reliability and low-latency apps.

Like JigSpace, which accelerates
setup of complex work spaces.

To set up a medical device
production facility,

Medtronic would normally create
a Six Sigma cardboard layout of the space,

taking weeks to design
and costing tens of thousands of dollars.

And now, with 5G
and the new LiDAR scanner,

iPhone 12 Pro enables teams
to immediately map the environment

and collaborate with their colleagues

to instantly place simulated equipment,

adapt it to the room layout
and outline process flows.

JigSpace on iPhone 12 Pro
enabled Medtronic

to completely transform projects
from weeks to hours,

reducing costs by more than 90%.

We really pushed the limits with
iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max

with stunning new designs
and larger displays.

They're packed with
our most innovative technologies

like the A14 Bionic chip, LiDAR scanner

and incredible pro camera system
powered by computational photography.

And now, here's a short film
we created about the iPhone 12 Pro.

[man narrating] A singular new design.

A reengineered chip.

And 5G.

This is iPhone 12 Pro.

The vertical band is precision-machined
from stainless steel.

The Ceramic Shield on the front
is tougher than any smartphone glass.

And tighter borders allow for
even larger Super Retina XDR displays.

5G is set to change the world
with radically faster speeds.

The hardware and software have been
optimized for the best 5G experience.

A14 Bionic has a smaller,
5-nanometer transistor,

which pushes the most powerful chip
in a smartphone generations ahead.

A new and improved pro camera system

makes the 12 Pro
the photographer's iPhone.

The larger iPhone 12 Pro Max
pushes these innovations even further.

Its bigger sensor
dramatically increases the detail captured

and helps improve low-light performance
by 87%.

The custom-designed LiDAR scanner

puts advanced depth-mapping technology
in your pocket.

You can now take a Night mode portrait

and unlock a new world of possibilities
for augmented reality.

iPhone 12 Pro smashes the benchmark
for highest quality video in a smartphone.

The movie industry can now count on it
as an essential piece of equipment.

It is the world's first device
able to capture, play back and edit

10-bit HDR footage with Dolby Vision.

iPhone 12 Pro comes in two sizes

and in four finishes,
including new Pacific Blue.

An integral part of this year's design
is MagSafe,

an intelligent system of magnets that
connect accessories in a whole new way.

All this and more make the iPhone 12 Pro
the most powerful iPhone ever.

Even with all of these incredible
pro technologies,

we are keeping the price
the same as today,

with iPhone 12 Pro starting at $999.

And we're doubling the starting capacity
to 128 GB.

And iPhone 12 Pro Max,
with our best cameras ever,

at $1,099.
