There's simply no other device
like iPad mini.

It gives users all the power of iPad
in its most portable form,

which makes it indispensable
for a wide range of uses,

like when it's secured to the leg
of a pilot in flight

or pulled from a doctor's lab coat
to care for patients in the ER.

iPad mini is in a class of its own.

And today we're giving our littlest iPad
its biggest upgrade ever.


As Tim said, we're giving iPad mini
a huge set of updatesâ€“

a complete redesign that puts everything
our users love about iPad

right in the palm of their hand.

The all-new enclosure features
a beautiful all-screen design

with narrow borders
and elegant rounded corners.

The design is remarkably thin and light
and absolutely stunning.

And iPad mini now comes
in a gorgeous array of new colors.

Purple, Pink, Starlight,
and Space Gray.

And this design features
a brilliant Liquid Retina display.

With this new design we were able
to increase the screen size

all the way out to 8.3 inches,
while keeping the same compact footprint.

With wide color, True Tone,
500 nits of brightness,

and the lowest reflectivity
in the industry,

everything you view on iPad mini
will look great wherever you go.

And delivering this edge-to-edge screen
meant finding a new location for Touch ID.

So just like iPad Air, we put it
right in the top button of iPad mini.

Touch ID is fast, easy, and secure,

whether you're unlocking your iPad
or using ApplePay.

iPad mini is already
the fastest device of its kind,

and the performance of the new iPad mini
is simply remarkable.

Compared to the previous generation,

the new iPad mini sees a 40% jump
in CPU performance

and a whopping 80% leap
in GPU performance.

So whether you're using ForeFlight

to navigate your flight plan
with live wind speed overlays

or playing the graphically rich game
"Star Wars: Hunters"

online with your friends,

the new iPad mini will power
right through it with ease.

And the Neural Engine, for powerful
machine learning applications,

also takes a big leap forward
on the new mini,

increasing performance by up to two times
over the previous generation.

Combined with the CPU and the GPU,

the Neural Engine enables apps

to deliver next-level experiences.

Like the new Translate app
in iPadOS 15,

which can automatically
translate a conversation in real time.

The performance of the new iPad mini
is on a whole new level.

And we know that iPad users rely
on ultra-fast connections.

Well, the most mobile iPad
is about to get a lot faster

and even more versatile.

iPad mini now has a USB-C port,

so you get
the same great USB-C functionality

that we brought to iPad Air,

which means it is up to ten times faster
than its predecessor.

So iPad mini can now connect
to a vast ecosystem of USB-C accessories,

which is great,
whether you're a photographer

who needs to connect to cameras
when shooting on location

or a doctor in a remote area
using Butterfly to conduct an ultrasound.

And when users are on the go,

it's crucial to have access
to the fastest cellular connections,

and that's why we're bringing 5G
to iPad mini.

Download speeds can be
up to 3.5 gigabits per second.

This is key when you need
to stay connected on the go,

like when technicians use Splunk AR
on-site

to access real time data,
performance analytics,

and complex schematics.

Or if you're using SharePlay
to take a MasterClass

with your friends.

5G keeps you connected.

Next, let's talk about
the cameras and audio.

Users rely on iPad mini for FaceTime,

taking photos and videos,
and experiencing AR,

so we've updated both the front
and back cameras.

The back camera now features
a 12 megapixel sensor with Focus Pixels

and a larger aperture

to capture sharp, vivid photos.

And we added a True Tone flash to mini
for improved photos in low light.

With a new ISP, users will see
enhanced photos with Smart HDR,

which improves image quality by recovering
details in shadows and highlights.

And now with the ability to record in 4K,

iPad mini becomes
your mobile movie studio.

On the front, iPad mini features
the new 12 MP Ultra Wide camera,

which means it also supports Center Stage.

As Melody mentioned,
this has been a huge hit on iPad Pro,

and now it's coming to iPad mini.

And iPad mini also features a new speaker
system with stereo in landscape,

great for listening
to your favorite playlist

or doing an Apple Fitness+ workout
in your hotel room.

And iPad mini's versatility is further
enhanced by its amazing accessories.

There's a new set of slim Smart Folio
covers in beautiful coordinating colors

that complement
the new iPad mini finishes,

perfect for expressing
your personal style.

And now, iPad mini supports the amazing
second-generation Apple Pencil,

which magnetically attaches
to the side of iPad mini

so it's always connected,
charged, and with you.

Apple Pencil transforms iPad mini
into your digital sketch book,

We're so excited about the new iPad mini.

Let's see it in action.

With its all-new design
and huge boost in performance,

the new iPad mini starts at just $499,

and it'll be available in both Wi-Fi
and cellular configurations.

You can order it today,
and it will be available next week.

So this is the all-new iPad mini

featuring a brilliant
liquid retina display,

super fast performance,

new cameras front and back,

Center Stage, 5G,
support for Apple Pencil,

and all-new colors.

With all of these new features,

this is by far the most powerful
and versatile iPad mini ever.


And with both the new iPad and iPad mini,

we continue our commitment
to the environment.

Both of these iPad models are built
with a 100% recycled aluminum enclosure.

And this marks a milestone for iPad.

Every single iPad in the lineup

now features
a 100% recycled aluminum enclosure.

This is just one of the many
ongoing efforts we have underway

to reduce the environmental impact
of our products.

Now back to Tim.
