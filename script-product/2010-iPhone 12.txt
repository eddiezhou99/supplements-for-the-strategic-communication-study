Now let's talk about iPhone.

iPhone is an incredibly powerful
and personal device.

It's the product we use the most
every day.

With amazing capabilities,
iPhone has changed our lives

and has never been
more indispensable than it is now.

It's been another big year for iPhone.

Ever since its launch, iPhone 11 has been
the most popular smartphone in the world.

People love their iPhones.

iPhone has led the industry
in customer satisfaction

every year since it was first introduced.

There's so much that people
love about their iPhones.

They love how easy it is to use,

how it connects people in personal ways,

how it elevates photography,

keeps us informed
and keeps us entertained.

With a powerful ecosystem of apps
in the App Store,

iPhone enables people to do
more and more things every day.

And users can trust that iPhone
is designed to do all of this

while protecting
their security and privacy.

Every decade,
there's a new generation of technology

that provides a step change
in what we can do with our iPhones.

The next generation is here.

Today is the beginning
of a new era for iPhone.

Today we're bringing 5G to iPhone.

This is a huge moment for all of us,
and we're really excited.

5G will bring a new level of performance
for downloads and uploads,

higher quality video streaming,
more responsive gaming,

real-time interactivity and so much more.

5G networks are more advanced,

with lower latency
and less network congestion.

So you can get higher network speeds
even in densely populated areas.

And 5G even helps protect
your privacy and security,

since you won't need to connect
to unknown, unsecured,

public Wi-Fi hotspots as often.

Each generation
of cellular network technology on iPhone

has enabled breakthrough innovations

and entirely new opportunities
for our developers and our users.

And 5G is the most exciting step yet.

For so many people, this all becomes real
with 5G coming to iPhone.

As you know,
iPhone provides seamless integration

of world-class hardware
and world-class software.

What you may not know about
is the incredible collaboration

between Apple and our carrier partners
around the world

to ensure iPhone users
get the best possible experience.

We're fortunate today to have
one of our closest partners join us.

I'd like to welcome Hans Vestberg,
Chairman and CEO of Verizon,

here to Apple Park.

Hans, this really is a big day.

And our teams have done
some amazing work together.

I want to thank you
and the whole Apple team

for a fantastic collaboration
leading up to this historic moment.

Until now, most people have taken
a "wait and see" approach to 5G.

They've been waiting for 5G to get real...

with the network coverage they expect,

the incredible performance
they have been promised,

and the devices they love.

Well, today with iPhone, the wait is over.

5G just got real.

Of course,
what's the most exciting part for me

as a guy who has worked in networking
for 25-plus years?

That fact that for the first time ever,

iPhone can now access
Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband.

It's built with large quantities
of mmWave spectrum

that enable unprecedented performance.

5G Ultra Wideband
has already been recognized

as being the fastest 5G in the world.

And it's getting even faster.

Our 5G network now gives you
double the peak download speeds:

over 4 gigabits per seconds today
in ideal conditions

and even higher over time.

And double the upload speeds
at over 200 megabits per second.

So whenever you're watching
a high-definition movie

or you're planning business workflows
with real-time augmented reality,

you can be sure that
there's no faster 5G anywhere on earth.

5G Ultra Wideband has, also,
a massive capacity.

We're building it to help remove
bottlenecks in crowded places

where thousands of people
use their phones at the same time.

Because one day
we'll be safely back in those places.

And so, we're nearly doubling
our 5G-enabled stadiums,

venues, airports, train stations,

and lighting up some of
the busiest locations in the country.

This enables amazing things,

like reinventing
the in-stadium fan experience

with our NFL partners.

The new Verizon 5G SuperStadium
experience in the NFL app

lets fans see and feel the action

from up to seven camera angles,
including views from players' eyes,

and an immersive augmented reality
like never before.

We're excited for NFL
to be rolling this out to many stadiums

through the course of the season.

And finally, 5G Ultra Wideband
provides you with super low latency,

so experiences like multiplayer gaming

feel like they're happening
in near real time,

freed from the confines of your home.

Together with Apple,

Verizon has partnered with one of
the world's leading gaming companies

for some exciting news
that you'll hear about later today.

To make this incredible experience
available to more people,

we're doubling down
on our fastest network,

the 5G Ultra Wideband,

with double the coverage
in existing cities

like New York, Chicago, Los Angeles,

and expanding into new cities
like Philadelphia and San Francisco,

with 60 cities by year-end.

In addition to our
5G Ultra Wideband network,

we have an extensive 5G network.

And today, we're excited to announce

that Verizon is turning on
our 5G Nationwide network,

reaching more than 200 million people
across more than 1,800 cities and towns.

So, all of the pieces
have now come together:

the coverage of 5G Nationwide,

the unprecedented performance of
5G Ultra Wideband in more and more cities,

the reliability you expect from Verizon.

With the first 5G iPhone
on the 5G America has been waiting for,

we can finally say, 5G just got real.

Hans, this is definitely
the start of something big.

Thank you for joining us,

and thank you for all the great work
we're doing together.

We are very excited about 5G on iPhone,

and we're going to introduce 5G

across our entire lineup
of new iPhone models today.

So now I'd like to show you
the very first iPhone with 5G.

Introducing iPhone 12.

To tell you all about it,
I'd like to hand it over to Kaiann.

Let's take a closer look
at iPhone 12 with 5G.

It has an all-new design
that's simply stunning.

It has smooth, flat edges,

allowing the aluminum frame and glass
to stay flush, front and back,

creating this unique uniform construction.

Inside and out, iPhone was re-architected

to pack in new technologies
into a smaller form factor.

iPhone 12 was designed with 5G in mind,

including the position of all-new antennas
which go around the aluminum frame.

The design looks amazing
in five stunning new colors:

black, white, (PRODUCT)RED, green
and a gorgeous blue.

iPhone 12 features the same great
6.1-inch display size as iPhone 11,

yet we reduced the display borders
to create a much smaller iPhone.

If we compare it to iPhone 11,

iPhone 12 is 11% thinner,

15% smaller in volume

and 16% lighter.

Keeping the display size and
reducing the footprint was only possible

by bringing our best display technology
to iPhone 12.

And that is our Super Retina XDR display.

Our new Apple-custom OLED
has many advantages over LCD.

Each OLED pixel has its own light
which can be individually controlled,

giving us pixel-precision brightness,
rich colors

and an amazing two-million-to-one
contrast ratio

for true blacks in photos, videos, games.

And Dark Mode looks fantastic.

The new OLED display
also has a higher resolution,

with twice as many pixels as iPhone 11.

It now has 460 pixels per inch.

So text will be sharper
for easier reading,

and your photos will look better,

with more detail, increased dynamic range
and precise color.

And peak brightness is nearly twice
as high for HDR content: 1,200 nits,

and we include support
for HDR video formats:

Dolby Vision, HDR10 and HLG.

We obsess over
making your display impeccable,

and of course it's important that
we protect your display in the best way.

The cover glass on iPhone 11
is the toughest in the industry,

but iPhone 12 leaps ahead
with something even better.

Much better.

Our incredible Materials Engineering team

has been working closely
with our partners at Corning,

the leaders in glass technology,

on a new cutting-edge material.

And we call it Ceramic Shield.

Ceramic Shield goes beyond glass

by adding a new high-temperature
crystallization step

which grows nanoceramic crystals
within the glass matrix

to dramatically improve toughness.

To make this material
both tough and optically clear,

we precisely control the type of crystals

and degree of crystallinity.

This was the breakthrough that made
Ceramic Shield possible for iPhone.

Ceramic Shield is tougher
than any smartphone glass,

and along with our new design
it makes iPhone more durable than ever.

We measured four times
better drop performance.

That means if your iPhone
accidentally slips out of your pocket,

Ceramic Shield will have four times
the chance of surviving without cracking.

This is the biggest jump in reliability
we've ever had on iPhone,

and we are thrilled
to bring that to iPhone 12.

Let's talk more about
the 5G capability on iPhone 12.

As Tim said, to create
the best possible 5G experience

it required seamless integration
of hardware and software,

and partnering closely with carriers.

Here's Arun to tell you more.

I'm here in one of our
50 world-class anechoic chambers

where we develop and test
advanced wireless capabilities like 5G.

And we approach this differently
than anyone else.

Starting with hardware, we designed
custom 5G antennas and radio components

that allow us to target exactly
what works best in the entire system.

We can be very space efficient

while also including the most 5G bands
in a single phone,

to work on 5G in more places
than any other smartphone.

Another Apple advantage is our ability
to engineer a fully integrated system

from silicon to software.

We analyzed our entire software stack
from applications down to firmware

to take advantage of 5G speeds.

For example, we optimized iOS frameworks,

so apps can get the benefit of 5G
without using more power.

5G makes iPhone faster.

We also made 5G smarter
with Smart Data mode.

When your iPhone doesn't need 5G speeds,

it automatically uses LTE to save battery.

But the instant 5G speeds do matter,
iPhone starts using it.

We also conduct rigorous validation.

For example,
this custom-built anechoic chamber

helps us replicate signals
from multiple sources and directions.

We use this data
to optimize our antenna system

and our unique beamforming algorithms.

To deliver 5G around the world,

we collaborate closely
with carrier partners,

ensuring iPhone has great throughput,

coverage, call quality and battery life.

We've completed 5G testing
on over 100 carriers

in over 30 regions,

and we're seeing impressive peak speeds
on iPhone 12.

Up to 3.5 gigabits per second
in ideal conditions.

Of course, 5G speeds will vary
by carrier and region.

In the US, we also support mmWave,

the high frequency version of 5G
on all iPhone 12 models.

This includes support for
Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband network.

This technology is ideal
for densely populated areas

and crowded stadiums.

With wider bandwidth,
it can deliver even higher speeds.

In fact, we have measured over
4 gigabits per second in ideal conditions

and up to 1 gigabit per second
in typical conditions.

This is just the beginning,

and we're excited to offer iPhone users
the best possible 5G experience.

Now back to Kaiann.

Now let's talk about the chip
that powers the new iPhone.

The A13 Bionic on iPhone 11
is still the fastest chip in a smartphone.

That's until now.

We have a new chip developed
by our world-class silicon team:

A14 Bionic, the fastest chip
ever in a smartphone.

Let me quickly take you
to our secret chip lab

where Hope will tell you all about it.

[beeping]

And finally, here's Hope.

Every year, iPhone sets the standard
for mobile performance,

even challenging
the performance of laptops.

This year, A14 Bionic

also marks a very important milestone
in the history of iPhone.

A14 Bionic
is the first smartphone chip in the world

built on the latest
5-nanometer process technology.

The reduction in transistor size
enables us to add features

and increase performance,

all while improving energy efficiency.

Our Silicon Engineering team

has packed 11.8 billion transistors
into A14 Bionic,

an increase of nearly 40% compared to A13.

A14 improves performance and efficiency
across the entire design of the chip,

starting with the CPU.

The new 6-core CPU in A14
is the fastest CPU in any smartphone.

In fact, it's up to 50% faster.

A14 also features
our latest 4-core GPU design,

driving increased image quality
and overall efficiency,

so it's even better for advanced games
and machine learning.

And compared to the competition,
it's the fastest GPU in any smartphone,

delivering up to 50% faster graphics.

We've also made
significant architectural changes

that push the limits of ML processing,

a critical design investment
to enable new experiences.

We've dramatically increased
the performance of our Neural Engine

by growing from 8 to 16 cores.

This change delivers
up to 80% faster performance

on the most critical
machine learning models.

This new Neural Engine

is capable of an astounding
11 trillion operations per second.

And we've also increased the performance
of our CPU's dedicated ML accelerators,

now 70% faster,

so our developers benefit

from considerably improved ML performance
on our entire chip.

Our silicon powers
every experience on the iPhone,

and with A14 Bionic
we make those experiences even better

with big updates to our CPU, GPU

and a dramatic increase
in machine learning capabilities.

Back to Kaiann.

A14 Bionic enables console-quality games.

With the faster speeds
and lower latency of 5G,

multiplayer gaming gets even better.

Later this year, one of the best games
of all time is coming to iPhone.

It has held the prestigious title

of most popular, most played
and most viewed game in the world

and revolutionized e-sports

with over 100 million people
watching the world championship last year.

I'm, of course,
talking about League of Legends.

Using the power of the new A14 Bionic

and Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband network,

iPhone gaming
is taking an enormous leap forward.

Here's Michael Chow,
executive producer from Riot Games,

to tell you more about it.

At Riot, we aspire to make games
that meet our players wherever they are.

League of Legends
is the world's most popular PC game.

But now with the insanely powerful
iPhone 12 and Verizon 5G,

we believe it's the perfect time
to bring League to iOS.

This is League of Legends: Wild Rift.

The power of A14 Bionic
literally blew us away.

It allows us to show off champions
like Ashe

with a brand-new level of fidelity
that you can't find on any other platform.

With off-the-charts GPU performance
and frames per second,

you get amazing details
and fluid gameplay,

even in the most chaotic team fights.

On iPhone 12, gameplay is always
responsive and unbelievably smooth.

Until now, to be competitive
in League of Legends,

you had to be tied to your desk.

But Verizon 5G frees you
to game like a pro

pretty much anywhere, no Wi-Fi required.

And with wicked-fast speeds
up to 25 times today's networks,

not only is gameplay fast,
but so are downloads.

So you can instantly grab dope new skins

that show off all your favorite champs.

We'll see you on the Wild Rift.

Wow! What a huge moment for mobile gaming.

We can't wait to play League of Legends
on iPhone 12.

A14 Bionic also combines
with our cameras and powerful software

to deliver the new dual-camera system
of iPhone 12.

It has the Ultra Wide camera
that people love

and use to take inspiring photos
in creative ways.

iPhone 12 also has a new Wide camera

with an f/1.6 aperture, our fastest yet.

This allows more light to hit the sensor,
making every photo better.

Along with the wider aperture,

we developed our first 7-element lens

to maintain sharp detail in your photo
from edge to edge.

This delivers a 27% improvement
in low-light performance,

so photos and videos all around
will have less noise and brighter results.

Like in this photo, with fantastic detail
in her hair, clothing,

and the sun's reflection.

On top of this,
we use computational photography

to deliver
even more powerful new features.

Our Smart HDR 3
continues to bring out details in faces,

like you see here
when the sun is so bright behind her.

Now it understands scenes
with machine learning

and applies more adjustments
to distinct parts of the photo.

For example, Smart HDR 3
brings out more detail in the rocks

and uses sky segmentation
to adjust for color, contrast and noise.

Computational photography
also enables Night mode,

which has been called
the best in the industry.

Night mode on iPhone 12 gets even better.

The faster aperture captures more light.

And now, we are expanding Night mode
to all cameras of iPhone 12,

for the first time on the Ultra Wide

and front TrueDepth camera,
which is perfect for Night mode selfies.

This is without a flash.

These cameras are incredible.

Let's take a look at other photos
shot on iPhone 12.

This photo makes use
of the Ultra Wide lens

while maintaining sharpness and clarity
like you see in the branches and leaves.

Here's another Ultra Wide photo,
shot from below.

Just look at the amazing details
in the clothing and chandeliers.

In this low-light portrait photo,

the color and warm light in the background
come together seamlessly.

For video,
iPhone continues to lead the industry

with the highest-quality video.

And with the larger aperture,
iPhone 12 video will get even better,

with big improvements in lower light.

We're adding Night mode time-lapse,

with longer exposure and brighter frames
when using a tripod.

We wanted to show you iPhone 12 in action,

so here's a video we shot and edited
entirely on iPhone 12.

["Why iii Love the Moon"
by Phony Ppl playing]

With an amazing camera on the go
and 5G speeds,

iPhone 12 takes us
into an even more wireless world.

We love wireless charging,
but want to improve the experience.

When setting down your phone, you can
miss the exact center of the charger,

which can result in slow,
less efficient charging, or none at all.

So with iPhone 12,
we are making this so much better.

But that's not all.

Introducing MagSafe for iPhone.

To tell you more, here's Deniz.

MagSafe is an advanced new system.

It starts by improving
the wireless charging experience.

Our wound wire coil,
which is unique in the industry,

now accommodates magnets

and maintains compatibility
with existing Qi chargers.

The magnets are optimized
for alignment and efficiency.

And we improved our shielding design

to safely provide up to 15 watts
for faster charging.

We use a custom nanocrystalline shield
to capture magnetic flux.

We also added two new sensors:

a single-turn coil NFC
and a sensitive magnetometer,

which senses magnetic field strength
and can instantly react to it.

This enables iPhone 12
to recognize and provide

a better experience for accessories.

Any MagSafe accessory
can simply snap onto the back of iPhone.

So, this is really great.

We're enabling a whole new ecosystem
for MagSafe,

starting with all-new cases for iPhone 12:

silicone, clear, leather...

which have magnets to snap on and off,
and they're far easier to use.

And you can use other MagSafe accessories
on top of the cases,

like the MagSafe charger.

And there's a MagSafe wallet.
It just snaps to the back of iPhone

and also works on top of MagSafe cases.

The leather sleeve uses MagSafe sensors

to identify when iPhone is inside
to reveal the clock.

We also developed
the new MagSafe Duo Charger

for your iPhone and Apple Watch.

You can charge both devices
with one charger,

and it folds up easily
for when you travel.

And these are just the accessories
we are introducing.

Belkin is already working
on a couple of new accessories:

a car mount and a multi-charger dock.

We can't wait to see the innovative ways
that others will use MagSafe,

creating a robust
and ever-expanding ecosystem.

Back to you, Kaiann.

We also have some big
environmental news for iPhone.

To tell you more, here's Lisa.

Today, Apple is carbon neutral
for our global corporate operations.

Our offices, stores and data centers
run on 100% renewable energy.

And we're proud of how far we've come.

But by 2030,

we plan to have net zero
climate impact across our entire business,

including our manufacturing supply chain
and all product life cycles.

This means that every Apple device sold,

from material collection,
component manufacturing,

assembly, transport,
customer use, charging,

all the way through recycling
and material recovery

will be 100% carbon neutral.

Many of iPhone 12's environmental features
build on our past progress,

removing harmful chemicals and using
renewable and recyclable materials.

And now, for the first time,

we are using 100% recycled
rare earth elements in all magnets,

including the camera, haptics and MagSafe.

We've also been transitioning
our iPhone manufacturing partners

to renewable energy.

And just like we did with Apple Watch,

we looked for ways to cut waste
and use less material.

Customers already have over 700 million
Lightning headphones.

And many customers have moved
to a wireless experience

with AirPods, Beats
or other wireless headphones.

And there are also over two billion
Apple power adapters out in the world,

and that's not counting the billions
of third-party adapters.

So we are removing these items
from the iPhone box,

which reduces carbon emissions

and avoids the mining and use
of precious materials.

Removing these items also means
a smaller, lighter iPhone box.

We can fit up to 70% more products
on a shipping pallet,

reducing carbon emissions
in our global logistics chain.

Taken altogether,
the changes we've made for iPhone 12

cut over two million metric tons
of carbon emissions annually.

It's like removing 450,000 cars
from the road per year.

This is huge, and we're really proud
that Apple is taking the lead.

We hope others will follow,

making this impact
even bigger for our planet.

Back to you, Kaiann.

Now every iPhone will include
the more advanced and higher power

USB-C to Lightning Cable.

It can be used with any standard
USB-C power adapter or computer port.

And USB-C enables fast charging.

So that's iPhone 12 with 5G.

But to add to all these big announcements,

we also wanted to do something
a little different.
