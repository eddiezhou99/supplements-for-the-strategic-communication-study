Apple Watch revolutionized
what a watch can do.

If you think about it, for over 100 years,

the traditional watch really focused on
just one thing: time.

Today, it's incredible
what Apple Watch enables you to do

right from your wrist.

I use my Apple Watch and
its amazing features throughout the day.

Before I go out in the morning,
I check the weather.

At work, Apple Watch notifies me

with everything from messages
to news alerts

and keeps me right on schedule.

I'm doing my best to stay in shape,

so it's great that Apple Watch
keeps track of my workouts

and motivates me to close my rings.

When I get home,
I use it to open the garage,

unlock my door and turn on the lights.

And when I'm ready to settle in,

I use Apple Watch
to stream my favorite music.

And it's so reassuring
for millions of customers

that Apple Watch has introduced
great health features

like heart monitoring, cycle tracking
and fall detection

and even the ability to take an ECG.

No wonder Apple Watch is
the most loved watch in the world.

I love reading the many messages
I get every day from Apple Watch users

telling me how the watch has changed,
and in some cases, saved their lives.

Like Ray from Texas.

She'd been experiencing pain
in her stomach,

but didn't think it was too serious.

When her Apple Watch alerted her
to an elevated heart rate,

she realized it really was.

She went to the ER,

where it was determined
she was in septic shock.

Ray got immediate intervention,

but she could have died
without that warning from her Apple Watch.

Or Enrique from Spain,

who's blind and uses his watch
for everything from speaking the time

to reminding him when his appointments are

to calling taxis and helping him keep fit.

For Enrique, his Apple Watch has become
an essential part of his day-to-day life.

Now I'd like you to meet a few more
of these people and hear their stories.

I really love hearing those stories

about how Apple Watch helps people
and enriches their lives.

And healthcare providers,
insurance companies and businesses

are also seeing the benefits
of offering Apple Watch.

They know it can make a big difference

in the lives of their patients,
customers and employees.

Recently, the Mount Sinai Health System
in New York

launched the new Warrior Watch Study.

Using data from Apple Watch,

researchers are studying
the impact of COVID

on the psychological well-being
of frontline healthcare workers

by identifying early signs of stress

while also looking to predict infection
before symptoms appear.

Singapore has one of the world's leading
healthcare systems.

This fall, Singapore will become
the first country

to leverage the benefits of Apple Watch

by offering incentives for people
to use it to stay healthy and active.

Apple Watch helps people understand
so much about their health and fitness

and to live a better day.

This year we're going to take it
even further.

Here's Jeff to tell you what's next.

Apple Watch has made a profound impact

on so many of our customers' lives,
and we continue to be inspired.

And this year, watchOS 7 adds
several important health features

that take advantage of
the powerful technology in Apple Watch.

The new Sleep app uses
the motion sensors to track your sleep.

Automatic handwashing detection

recognizes the motion and sound
when washing your hands

and encourages you to continue
for the recommended 20 seconds.

And watchOS 7 now uses
your motion and heart rate

to measure a lower range
of VO2 Max values.

Now, the American Heart Association
recommends

routinely assessing cardio fitness levels,

and VO2 Max is the most accurate way
to capture this.

The problem is, it's usually only measured
in specialty clinics.

Well, watchOS 7 can now measure
a full range of VO2 Max,

which is a powerful predictor
of your overall health.

And coming later this year,

you can receive a notification if
your VO2 Max drops to those lower levels.

Each year, Apple Watch raises the bar,

adding new features and technology
that improve our lives.

This year, Apple Watch
takes another big leap forward.

And I'm excited to show it to you now.

This is the new Apple Watch Series 6.

The perfect combination of
powerful features and beautiful design.

Series 6 is our most colorful lineup ever.

There's a new blue aluminum case,

this updated
classic gold stainless steel finish,

a new gray-black stainless steel
called Graphite

and for the first time, a stunning new
Apple Watch (PRODUCT)RED.

Now on the inside, Series 6 is
packed with incredible technology,

including a new health sensor
that enables an amazing new capability.

Let's take a look.

With Apple Watch Series 6,

you can measure your blood oxygen
right from your wrist.

The new health sensor in Series 6

shines red and infrared light
onto your wrist

and measures the amount of light
reflected back.

Advanced algorithms use this data
to calculate the color of your blood,

which indicates
the amount of oxygen present.

The new Blood Oxygen app lets you
take a measurement in just 15 seconds.


And Series 6 also captures
periodic background readings

and stores them in your Health app.

So if you wear your Apple Watch to bed,

it can record background measurements
while you sleep.

I'll hand it over to Sumbul

to talk more about blood oxygen
and its importance to your health.

Blood oxygen saturation,
also known as SpO2, is like a vital sign.

It's a key measurement that contains

critical information about
your breathing and circulation.

Apple Watch
is already a powerful health tool,

with apps that measure heart rate
and heart rhythm.

And now, adding blood oxygen

brings another valuable
health measurement to users.

Blood oxygen and pulse oximetry

are terms that we've heard a lot about
during the COVID pandemic.

As you breathe,
your heart and lungs work together

to deliver oxygen throughout your body.

Blood oxygen saturation is an indication
of how well this system is functioning

and of your overall respiratory
and cardiac health.

And pulse oximetry is how you measure it.

Now, the Blood Oxygen app on Series 6
lets you measure your blood oxygen

for fitness and wellness purposes
from your wrist

anywhere and at any time.

This is a great new tool
for your overall well-being.

And to enable future medical discoveries,

we're launching three new
health research studies

to learn how longitudinal
blood oxygen measurements,

along with other health metrics
from Apple Watch,

can help manage conditions
that affect the heart and lungs.

First, to study how to better manage
and control asthma

using physiological signals
from Apple Watch,

we're collaborating
with the pulmonary experts

at the University of California, Irvine
and Anthem.

Second, to learn more about how metrics,
including blood oxygen,

can be used to manage heart failure,

we're partnering with one of the largest
research organizations in North America,

the University Health Network,

and the investigators
at the University of Toronto.

And finally, as we all continue
to learn more about COVID

and understand
the interplay with influenza,

we're partnering with the investigators
of the Seattle Flu Study

and faculty from the University
of Washington School of Medicine.

We will explore how changes
in blood oxygen and heart rate

could be early signals of the onset
of these respiratory conditions.

So that's the new blood oxygen feature.

We're so excited to bring this important
new health capability to our users.

Now, back to Jeff to tell you more about
the new Apple Watch Series 6.

Whether you're measuring blood oxygen,

making a phone call on your watch

or simply checking your Activity Rings,

it's all made possible by Apple Silicon.

Inside Series 6 is our sixth-generation
System in Package.

It's a purpose-built design
that's absolutely unique in the industry.

It includes a high performance
dual-core processor

based on the A13 Bionic in iPhone 11

but optimized for Apple Watch.

The S6 is up to 20% faster
than the previous generation.

Series 6 also has great new features

that are perfect
for when you're out and about.

Let's head outside and take a look.

Because of its energy-efficient design,

Series 6 has an even better
Always-On Display,

making it easier to read your watch
on sunny days

without having to wake the display.

Now it's two-and-a-half times
brighter outdoors

when your wrist is down.

Series 6 also features
a new always-on altimeter

that provides continuous elevation
throughout the day.

So on your next hike,

you can see your elevation change
in real time,

right on your watch face.

And at any time, no matter where you are,

you can measure
your blood oxygen saturation

right from your wrist.


Now let's talk about watch faces.

The watch face is fundamental
to the Apple Watch experience.

And we're taking faces further this year,

starting with some great new designs.

And we'd like to share them with you now.

The watch face is the most powerful
and personal aspect of Apple Watch.

Our approach to face design
begins with a deep respect

for the history of timekeeping.

We combined that sense of craft

with the powerful technologies
and capabilities of Apple Watch

to create these new faces.

The GMT face shows
multiple time zones at once

and takes into account where you are.

The Count-up face lets you
start tracking elapsed time

from any given point.

And inspired by classic racing watches,

the Chronograph Pro face
features multiple time scales,

including a tachymeter to measure speed

based on time traveled
over a set distance.

In the Typograph face,

numerals can be displayed
in three custom type styles

and four different scripts.

Every combination is tailored
to fit the face perfectly.

We also collaborated with
the artist Geoff McFetridge

to create a unique piece of art
for your watch.

There are millions of combinations,

and a different one animates
when you raise your wrist.

The Memoji face brings
your favorite Memoji to your watch.

Each one moves and reacts to your touch.

And with the Stripes face,

you can show your pride in who you are,
support your favorite team

or even match what you're wearing.

We're so proud to add to
the legacy of Apple Watch faces

with this new collection.

In watchOS 7,
we also gave developers new tools

to build even more specialized
watch faces.

So if you're into surfing,
there's a watch face for that,

with apps like Dawn Patrol
to check surf conditions.

Or if you're into photography,
there's a watch face for that,

with apps like Lumy
to help you track the sun's position.

Or if you're a healthcare provider,
there's a watch face for that,

with apps like Notable
to see your upcoming appointments.

Watch faces have always been a great way
to personalize your Apple Watch.

Another is interchangeable bands.

Now, traditional watch bands
have a clasp or a buckle,

and they're limited to
a few preset sizes for fit.

Well, today we're excited to introduce
something completely different.

We call it the Solo Loop.

The Solo Loop is remarkably simple.

No clasp, no buckle, no overlapping parts.

Just one continuous piece.

Made from custom liquid silicone,

the Solo Loop is stretchable, so you can
easily slip it on and off your wrist.

It looks great, and it's durable,
and it's swimproof,

so it can go anywhere.

It's available in a range of sizes

so you can find your most comfortable fit.

And it comes in seven fantastic colors.

This new band style is so comfortable,

we did another version called...

the Braided Solo Loop.

It's made from 100% recycled yarn

that's meticulously braided
with ultrathin silicone threads,

and it will be available in five colors.

We're also offering a new take
on the leather band

with the new Leather Link,

with no loop-back or clasp of any kind.

There are also great new updates
for Apple Watch Nike,

with fun new Sport Band
and Sport Loop colors

plus a new Nike watch face.

And for Apple Watch Hermès,
we're introducing the new Attelage band,

in both single tour...

and double tour.

That's Apple Watch Series 6,

the most advanced Apple Watch ever.

We think you're gonna love
all the amazing new features.

This year we're doing
two additional things

to make Apple Watch available
to even more people.

And the first is an entirely new way
for families to use Apple Watch.

And here's Deidre
to tell you all about it.

Apple Watch is essential
for staying connected to those you love,

whether that's a child or an older adult.

Right now,
Apple Watch needs to pair with an iPhone,

which is something they might not have.

This is why we're excited
to introduce Family Setup.

With Family Setup, you can use your iPhone
to pair watches for your children

or older members in your household
who don't have their own phones.

And they will have
their own phone number and account.

Let me show you how it works.

Family Setup enables greater independence
for your kids or older parents.

And you have the comfort of knowing
they're just a call away.

You get the safety and communication
features that technology can deliver

in a device
that can be managed responsibly.

For example,

you can specify which contacts
your kids can communicate with

when using Messages and more.

And you can set up
automatic location notifications.

So whether it's Grandma's house,
school or basketball practice...

you'll get the reassurance your child is
exactly where you expect them to be.

To help them stay active,
kids can now track Move minutes

and use all of the other great features
of Activity and Workout

in a way that works best for them.

Kids can create a Memoji
with just their watch

and share it as stickers in Messages
or in the new Memoji watch face.

Whether they're learning at home
or in the classroom,

the new Schooltime mode
helps kids stay focused

with Do Not Disturb,
restricted interaction

and this distinctive look, which teachers
or parents can recognize at a glance.

These are just some of the ways

Family Setup
provides kids and older adults

with the powerful and unique
benefits of Apple Watch,

even if they don't have an iPhone.

Family Setup requires a cellular model
of Apple Watch Series 4 and later

and will be available at launch
with these carrier partners...

in these regions around the world,

with more coming later this year.

And that's Family Setup. Back to Jeff.

We think Family Setup will
keep families more connected,

giving kids
greater independence and agency

and you more peace of mind.

The second thing we're doing

to make Apple Watch available
to even more people

is to create a new model that combines
elements of Series 6 design

with the most essential features
of Apple Watch,

all at a more affordable price.

We call it Apple Watch SE.

Apple Watch SE has
the features customers love.

It has everything you need
to stay connected,

be more active
and keep an eye on your health.

And like Series 6,

Apple Watch SE uses our largest
and most advanced watch display,

allowing you to see
so much more at a glance.

More information and apps
on your watch face.

More in Messages, Calendar and Maps.

And larger and easier-to-read metrics
while you're working out.

And for fast access
to information and apps,

Apple Watch SE uses the S5 chip,

for up to two times faster performance
than Series 3.

And staying connected is even easier
with the cellular models,

which allow you to make phone calls,
send messages and more,

even without your phone.

And with Family Setup,

cellular models of Apple Watch SE
will also be great for kids.

Customers love using Apple Watch
for fitness and working out,

and Apple Watch SE has
the same accelerometer, gyroscope,

compass and altimeter as Series 6.

And because it has
the latest motion sensors,

Apple Watch SE
also supports fall detection,

a feature that's made
a lifesaving difference

for many Apple Watch wearers.

With all of these features and more,

including the new capabilities
in watchOS 7,

we think Apple Watch SE will be
the perfect watch for many new customers.

Apple Watch SE starts at just $279.

In addition, we're announcing
Apple Card Financing for Apple Watch,

so customers can easily pay
across 24 monthly payments.

Apple Watch Series 6,

with the breakthrough
new blood oxygen sensor,

starts at just $399.

And Series 3 continues
at its great entry price of just $199.

With three great Apple Watch models
to choose from,

there really is
an Apple Watch for everyone.

Now let's talk about what Apple Watch
is doing to protect the environment.

Apple's commitment to the environment
spans everything we do,

from how we design our products
to the materials that go in them

to how they're manufactured.

And here's Lisa to share
some of the many things Apple is doing

to reduce our environmental footprint.

We're proud that all of our corporate
operations worldwide are carbon neutral.

And we've done it by replacing
dirty energy with clean renewable power.

All of our offices,
retail stores and data centers

run on 100% renewable energy.

We're also proud that we've cut
our comprehensive carbon footprint

by 35% since 2015.

And you may have heard

we're now taking
our environmental commitment even further,

starting with a promise.

By 2030, Apple will be 100% carbon neutral

for our entire end-to-end footprint,

including our supply chain and products.

To keep our promise,

we're focusing on
not just the energy we use

but the materials needed
to make our products.

Let's take a look at Apple Watch.

Beginning last year,
our aluminum watch cases

are made with 100% recycled aluminum.

And for Series 6, we're now using

100% recycled rare earth elements
and tungsten

in the Taptic Engine.

And we go to great lengths

to make sure our products
are free of harmful chemicals.

Like all of our products,

Apple Watch is free of BFR,
PVC, beryllium and mercury,

and the display glass
is made without arsenic.

And all of the fiber in our packaging
comes from recycled sources

or responsibly managed forests.

Sometimes, it's not what we make
but what we don't make that counts.

We know that customers have been
accumulating USB power adapters,

and that producing
millions of unneeded adapters

consumes resources
and adds to our carbon footprint.

So this year, we are removing
the USB power adapter from Apple Watch.

We're also helping
our Apple Watch manufacturing partners

transition to renewable energy.

That, combined with
removing the power adapter,

will result in eliminating
the carbon equivalent

of over 50,000 cars
from our roads per year.

We have lots more to do,
and we'll have lots more to share

in the months and years to come.

Now back to Jeff.

These actions are significant and lasting,

and I'm proud of the great work
Apple is doing to protect our planet.

So that's our lineup.

Apple Watch Series 6
with the new blood oxygen sensor,

the most advanced Apple Watch yet.

And the very capable and affordable
Apple Watch SE.

You can order both today,
and availability starts this Friday.

To celebrate the launch
of the new Apple Watch Series 6,

we created a video to show you
just how far the watch has come.

And here it is.
