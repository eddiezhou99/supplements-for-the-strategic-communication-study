I love my iPad because it is
such an incredibly versatile device.

Powerful and easy to use,

it enables all of us to do
so many meaningful things every day.

And now more than ever,
iPad has become even more important,

keeping us close to the ones we love
when we can't be there in person,

helping students learn remotely,

helping people express and share
their creativity,

reshaping how the world communicates.

And iPad is providing a critical lifeline
for doctors, nurses and patients.

Its versatility is what makes iPad
such an essential device.

With the power of the App Store
and over a million iPad apps,

the iPad can do
whatever you need it to do.

We're inspired to see how iPad's impact
has been felt across the world.

This year marks the ten years
since we shipped our very first iPad.

And in that time, it has become

one of the most successful
consumer electronics products ever.

We've now sold over 500 million iPads
to customers around the world.

And more and more new customers
are just discovering iPad

for the very first time.

In fact,

more than half of our iPad customers
are buying their very first iPad.

That's just incredible!

And users love their iPads.

iPad has been ranked number one
in customer satisfaction

for ten straight years--

every year since it launched.

Our users are doing more than ever
with iPad,

so we continue to push iPad forward.

This is a big year for iPad.

Earlier this year, we made
some great updates to the iPad Pro,

including the A12Z chip,

new pro camera system,

LiDAR Scanner and so much more.

Today, we're updating
the rest of our full-size iPad lineup,

starting with our most popular iPad.

And here's Ted to tell you more about it.

We're incredibly proud of the role iPad
is playing in the lives of so many people.

Users love our iPad 7th generation

because it delivers a beautiful
10.2-inch Retina display

with support for Apple Pencil
and the full-size Smart Keyboard

all in a thin, light
and affordable design.

And our customers love
all the things they can do with it,

from taking notes
as they learn something new

to playing their favorite game.

So this year,
we're taking its beloved design

and cranking up the performance
with this...

the new iPad 8th generation.

It's more capable than ever,

and it starts with the A12 Bionic.

This chip is a powerhouse.

It features a powerful CPU
and superfast GPU.

Compared to the already fast chip
in last year's iPad,

it has a 40% faster CPU

and delivers a massive two-times jump
in graphics.

This extra performance is great

for everything from
working with high-resolution content

to immersive gaming experiences.

And compared to the competition
over the last year, it's not even close.

This new iPad with the A12 Bionic
is up to two times faster

than the top-selling Windows laptop,

it's up to three times faster
than the top-selling Android tablet,

and it's up to a whopping six times faster
than the top-selling Chromebook.

iPad leaves the competition in the dust.

And all that power is delivered
in a thin and light design

that's super portable with great cameras
and all-day battery life.

Now, our A-series chips are
more than a CPU and GPU.

They include powerful custom technologies,

like the Neural Engine
for machine learning,

which comes to our most popular iPad
for the very first time.

It's capable of processing
up to five trillion operations per second.

And it powers some magical experiences
on iPad,

like allowing you to instantly transform
the color of your photos

or even analyze your tennis game

and provide real-time stats
like ball speed and body positioning.

Altogether, the A12 Bionic
takes performance to the next level

and makes iPad more powerful than ever.

Now let's talk about accessories.

They expand the versatility of iPad.

iPad 8th gen
works with the full-size Smart Keyboard

and keyboards from Logitech,

like the Combo Touch with trackpad

and the Rugged Combo
that's so important for schools.

And of course, this new iPad works
with one of our most beloved accessories,

Apple Pencil.

With its incredible precision
and low latency,

plus features like
pressure sensitivity and tilt,

it's the gold standard for creativity

and enables artists
to bring their vision to life.

And we've seen it become an essential tool
to journal and take detailed notes.

We're blown away
by what we've seen people create

with Apple Pencil on iPad.

There's really nothing else like it.

And taking the Apple Pencil experience
to a whole new level is iPadOS 14,

which adds
powerful new pencil capabilities

and other new features as well.

Let's see it in action.

iPadOS 14 makes iPad even more intuitive,
fun and productive,

because you can get your work done
just about anywhere.

Handwritten text is just as powerful
as typed text.

iPadOS even understands what you write,

letting you take quick actions
with just a tap.

As you sketch,

shape recognition helps you draw
perfect circles, stars and more.

Smart Selection understands the difference
between handwriting and drawings,

making it easy
to select only what you want

and paste your handwritten notes
as typed text into another app.

New compact UIs mean
you can stay focused on the task at hand.

And we know,
once you start using Apple Pencil,

you're not gonna want to put it away.

So, we have Scribble,

which lets you handwrite
into any text field,

even straight into numbers...

or to add a final thought
to that document you've been working on.

The new iPad and the power of iPadOS 14
are an amazing combination,

making it possible to express your ideas
however you want to,

wherever you are.

With iPadOS 14,

the already amazing experience
of Apple Pencil gets even better.

These powerful handwriting
and note-taking features

join a host of other new features

that continue to push
what's possible on iPad.

And it all runs beautifully
on the new iPad 8th generation

with its 10.2-inch Retina display,

huge performance boost
from the A12 Bionic,

keyboard and pencil support,

great cameras and so much more.

And it starts at just $329.

And it's just $299
for our education customers.

Nothing else delivers
this level of performance and capability

at such an affordable price.

Customers can order
iPad 8th generation today,

and it will be available
starting this Friday.

Now back to Tim.

iPad 8th generation,
with its huge boost in performance,

and the incredible features in iPadOS 14

will enable even more people
to do more amazing things.

And that's not all.

As I told you, we're updating
our entire full-size lineup.
