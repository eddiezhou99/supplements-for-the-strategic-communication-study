So that brings us to iPad Air.

iPad Air was designed to deliver
pro features at a very affordable price.

And today we are thrilled to introduce

an all-new,
completely redesigned iPad Air.

And here it is.

This is the new iPad Air.

And to tell you all about it,
I'd like to hand it over to Laura.

The new iPad Air starts
with a gorgeous design.

The all-new thin and light enclosure
and narrow border design

features a beautiful all-screen display.

Each element of iPad Air
is meticulously crafted,

from the precisely machined top button

to the sculpted detail around the camera.

And the new iPad Air design
comes in five gorgeous colors,

including a new rose gold,
green and sky blue finish.

Our customers are going to love
these colors.

And this new design features
a stunning Liquid Retina display.

In the same footprint as the previous Air,

the new iPad Air features a larger,
10.9-inch Liquid Retina display

with a resolution of 2360 by 1640.

That's over 3.8 million pixels

for extra-crisp text and photos.

And, it has advanced display technologies
like full lamination,

wide color, True Tone

and an anti-reflective coating

that, combined,
deliver an amazing visual experience.

To give our customers
this beautiful all-screen design

meant finding a new home
for one of the most popular features:

Touch ID.

So we designed a next-generation Touch ID

and integrated it
right into the top button.

This provides convenient
and secure authentication

while allowing the display
to extend on all sides.

This is the smallest authentication sensor
we have ever designed,

and it delivers the same performance,
ease of use and security

you know and trust from Touch ID.

The technology under the button
is really amazing.

It uses a sapphire crystal lens
and next-generation custom sensor

that more efficiently captures
the details of a fingerprint.

And it uses a faster Secure Enclave

to more quickly authenticate
the fingerprint data.

And using it is as simple as ever:

just touch the top button
to unlock your iPad,

log in to apps or use Apple Pay.

It's fast, easy and secure.

Another reason customers love iPad Air
is its performance.

So we're debuting
an incredibly powerful new chip

which is going to give the new Air
a huge leap in performance.

To tell you more, here's Tim Millet.

I'm super excited to tell you
about the powerful new chip

we built into the new iPad Air:

our latest A-series processor, A14 Bionic.

Our goal is to build chips
with industry-leading performance,

powerful custom technologies
and extremely efficient use of energy

to make every one of our products
best in class.

One way we do this
is by aggressively adopting

cutting-edge silicon process technology
year after year.

And now with A14,
we'll be the first in the industry

to use the breakthrough
five-nanometer process technology.

The incredibly small scale of this process
challenges the laws of physics.

In fact, we're talking about
a scale so small,

the dimensions of these five-nanometer
transistors are measured in atoms.

This means we were able to pack
11.8 billion transistors into A14.

That's an increase of nearly 40%
over our seven-nanometer chip.

We use these additional transistors
to deliver new features,

increased power efficiency
and increased performance

in nearly every aspect of the chip.

A14 Bionic includes a big update
to our CPU.

Our architecture runs
more instructions in parallel,

resulting in great performance
at lower power.

And it integrates large,
high-performance caches

sized to meet the needs
of the most demanding applications.

For A14's powerful new six-core design,

this results in an enormous 40% increase
in CPU performance

compared to the previous iPad Air.

A14 also features
our newest GPU architecture,

scaled to deliver
the maximum sustainable performance

at the lowest possible power--

an approach that also allows us to deliver
industry-leading peak performance

when it's needed most.

For A14, our new four-core design delivers

a 30% increase
in graphics performance as well.

And when you compare
the new iPad Air with A14

to the best-selling laptop
in its price range,

a device nearly three times thicker
and four times heavier,

the new iPad Air has up to two times
faster graphics performance

in its incredibly thin and light design.

So for customers using iPad Air
for performance-intensive apps

like editing 4K videos,
creating works of art

or playing immersive games,

the incredible performance of A14
can handle them all with ease.

In addition to the blazing-fast CPU
and GPU,

A14 is loaded with custom technologies
that drive the unique iPad experience,

like a much faster Neural Engine,

which will make iPad Air more powerful
for machine learning.

By doubling the number of cores
to build a 16-core architecture,

the Neural Engine in A14 is capable
of executing

an amazing 11 trillion operations
per second.

This increases ML performance by up to
two times over the previous generation.

In addition, our CPU is further optimized

with second-generation
machine learning accelerators,

which come to iPad for the first time

and accelerate the matrix multiplication
frequently used in ML computations

at up to ten times faster
than the previous Air.

Now, the combination
of the new Neural Engine,

the CPU ML accelerators
and our high-performance GPU

deliver breakthrough
machine learning capabilities

to elevate apps built on Core ML
to an entirely new level of performance.

So that's the new A14 Bionic.

It delivers big performance updates
for the CPU and GPU,

makes iPad Air much more powerful
for machine learning

and also features the latest ISP
for higher-quality videos and photos

and even faster Secure Enclave
for Touch ID.

This is by far the most advanced chip
we've ever made,

and we're thrilled
to bring it to the new iPad Air.

Now back to you, Laura.

Wow, the A14 is a huge leap forward
in performance.

And we've worked with
a number of developers

to see what they can do
with the new iPad Air.

So let's take a look.

I'm Karim Morsy.
I'm a developer of djay Pro AI.

djay Pro AI is an app that brings all
the tools of a professional DJ to iPad.

The A14 Bionic allows us to build
intelligent features into the app.

You touch the record,
and then you start scratching.

You can actually scratch in the air.

It just blows our mind
that this is possible now.

Hi, I'm Alexey from Pixonic,
developer of the game War Robots.

The A14 Bionic chip allows us
to deliver console-level graphics

on a device you can hold in your hands.

It's quite amazing to have a real-time,
six-versus-six multiplayer game

running on iPad at 60 frames per second.

For example,
the textures are much more detailed,

the shadows are dynamic,

and reflections are more realistic.

It looks amazing.

I'm Andrius, and we're from Pixelmator.

Pixelmator Photo is a photo editing app
for enhancing photos.

So I think everyone's seen the movies
where somebody's pointing at a screen,

and goes, "Okay, zoom in on that.
Now, enhance."

And now I've brought that to iPad.

The Apple Neural Engine
allows us to build functionality

we never thought possible.

The ML Super Resolution feature
finds individual details:

edges, colors, gradients, textures,

and it combines it back in an image.

Now, we can build intelligent features
into the app.

The possibilities
are just endless with this.

With the A14 chip,

the new Air is going to bring
incredible performance

to customers looking to step up
to a more powerful iPad.

And there's more.

Another great feature
we're bringing to iPad Air is USB-C.

USB-C increases data transfer speeds
up to 5 gigabits per second.

That's a tenfold jump in performance
over the previous Air.

It provides a fast connection
to a host of external devices,

like cameras, drives
and external monitors up to 4K.

The new Air also includes
great cameras front and back.

The front 7-megapixel FaceTime HD camera
supports Smart HDR,

improved 1080p video capture
and better low-light performance

for really high-quality video calls.

And on the back is the same
12-megapixel camera used in the iPad Pro,

with focus pixels and a larger aperture
to capture incredibly sharp photos

and stunning 4K video,

enhanced with
improved video stabilization,

so the photos and videos
our customers take with the new Air

are gonna look better than ever.

And to elevate the audio experience,
we've redesigned the speaker system,

providing stereo audio in landscape mode.

Great for kicking back and enjoying
your favorite movies and TV shows.

The new Air also works
with our amazing accessories,

including Apple Pencil,

which attaches magnetically to the side
for pairing, charging and storage,

and the beautiful Magic Keyboard,

with floating design
and built-in trackpad.

So this is the new iPad Air,

featuring a 10.9-inch
Liquid Retina display,

next-generation Touch ID,

a huge boost in performance
with A14 Bionic,

USB-C, advanced cameras,

Wi-Fi 6 and LTE that's 60% faster.

This is by far
the most powerful iPad Air ever.

Let's check it out.

So that's the new iPad Air,

and we can't wait
to get it into our customers' hands.

It'll start at $599.

It will be available beginning next month.

And finally, we're very proud that

the new Air and eighth-generation iPad
have been carefully designed

to have minimal impact on the environment

and support
our overall net zero carbon goal.

Both iPads use
100% recycled aluminum enclosures,

and all of the wood fiber in the packaging
of both iPad models is recycled

or comes from responsibly managed forests.

Both iPads use 100%-recycled tin solder
in their main logic boards

and are free of harmful substances.

So while our work here is never finished,

we're proud of the progress we've made
with these new products.

So today, we have
our most advanced iPad lineup ever.

It's really a huge year for iPad:

an incredible new iPad Air delivering
more pro features to even more customers,

an iPad 8th generation
with massive jump in performance,

together with the latest iPad Pro

and the mighty iPad mini,

combined with the advanced features
in iPadOS 14

make these by far the most exciting
iPads we've ever shipped.
