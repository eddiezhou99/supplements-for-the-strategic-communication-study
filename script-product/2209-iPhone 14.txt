People love iPhone and it's
an important part of our daily lives.

We're constantly challenging ourselves
to raise the bar

to make it better and even more loved.

So let's take a look at the new iPhone.

As you can see,
we're going big with iPhone 14,

and even bigger with iPhone 14 Plus.

Here's Kaiann to tell you all about it.


The popular 6.1" size of iPhone 14

is joined by the new,
larger 6.7" size of iPhone 14 Plus.

With a larger display,
you can enjoy more content

when browsing the web.

You can see more text or larger text.

It looks great
with the incredible features of iOS 16,

like the new Lock Screen

and iCloud shared Photo Library.

You can even get more workout details
in the Fitness app

with the new Enhanced Workout Summary.

With a larger display,

you have more area
to watch your favorite show

or play your most intense game.

iPhone 14 also has an updated
internal design

that improves thermal performance, which
is great for staying in the action longer.

Both models have the gorgeous
Super Retina XDR display

with OLED technology that supports
1200 nits peak HDR brightness,

two million-to-one contrast ratio,
and Dolby Vision.

iPhone 14 is designed to last,

so you can count on it to be there
for you.

Both models have Ceramic Shield–

tougher than any smartphone glass–

aerospace grade aluminum,
and water and dust resistance.

They come in five gorgeous colors:
Midnight, Starlight,

a great new shade of blue,
a strikingly elegant purple,

and a truly eye-catching PRODUCT(RED).

Users depend on their iPhone
for so many things,

which is why iPhone 14 delivers
all-day battery life.

iPhone 14 Plus lasts even longer
throughout your day

with the best battery life ever
in an iPhone.

The larger display and best battery life

were previously only available

in our Pro Max models,

and now we're bringing it
to even more people.

Now, let's talk about performance.

iPhone 13 Pro introduced an amazing chip:

the A15 Bionic with a 5-core GPU.

It's a powerhouse that unlocks
extraordinary features

and delivers great power efficiency,
privacy, and security.

Now we are bringing this proven,
Pro-level performance to iPhone 14.

The 5-core GPU is 18% faster,

enabling even smoother graphics
in computationally heavy workloads

like complex gaming.

It has a powerful 6-core CPU
with two high-performance

and four efficiency cores,

and a 16-core Neural Engine

that pushes the limits
of machine learning.

Since its introduction,
A15 continues to be faster

than all the competition
at any price.

A15 is essential to iPhone 14.

And with a custom image signal processor,

A15 also powers innovative features
in the amazing new camera system.

Here's Caron to tell you more.

iPhone is always with you

and ready to quickly and effortlessly
capture your life's moments.

Last year, over three trillion photos
were taken with iPhone!

We develop unique,
state-of-the-art camera technology

while staying true
to the craft of photography.

Lighting is a fundamental part
of getting the best shot possible.

It plays such an important role
in capturing everyday memories

and jaw-dropping moments.

iPhone enables gorgeous photo capture
across the entire range of light–

from bright light,
where colors come alive,

to low light, like indoors,

to nighttime scenes.

And iPhone 14 again sets
the standard for photo

and video capture
regardless of where you are.

It has a new 12MP Main camera
with a larger sensor,

and larger pixels at 1.9 microns.

It has a larger f/1.5 aperture

and sensor-shift OIS

for a powerful Main camera upgrade
and takes stunning shots everywhere.

The faster aperture
allows better motion freezing,

showing off vibrant colors
that bring the scene to life

with great texture and detail.

It delivers a 49% improvement
in low light capture,

for more vibrant color and better results
in challenging lighting environments,

while making Night mode exposure
twice as fast.

And the Ultra Wide camera takes
incredible-looking photos and video,

which is great for wider shots
and unique perspectives.

The front camera enables
great-looking selfies,

high quality video during FaceTime,
and so much more.

iPhone 14 has a new TrueDepth camera.

It has a faster f/1.9 aperture

for a 38% improvement in low light capture
for photos and video.

The new front camera has autofocus
for the first time,

so it can focus clearly
at multiple distances.

Together with TrueDepth capabilities,

the front camera now has a hybrid system

that can focus faster, even in low light.

So you'll get better selfies, group shots
can be in focus from farther away,

and you'll be able to show off
great detail up close.

Low light environments can be
a unique challenge with photography.

We've made incredible progress
in capturing in low light over the years

with increasingly larger sensors
and faster apertures,

more advanced lenses–

all paired with intelligent software

and our powerful Apple silicon that result
in incredible capabilities for low light.

Deep Fusion is a great example.

It's a huge achievement
in computational photography

and uses the powerful Neural Engine

to combine multiple frames
into a single image.

This delivers extraordinary detail

and preserves even the subtlest textures
in these mid- to lower-light environments.

Now, we are taking
our image pipeline further

by applying Deep Fusion much earlier in
the process on uncompressed images.

This retains much more information
and detail,

and enables rendering of more colors
and brighter colors.

This new process unlocks our biggest step
forward yet for low light performance.

We call it Photonic Engine.

This is our enhanced image pipeline

that dramatically improves
low-light photos.

It goes beyond what hardware alone
can provide.

The best part is that it benefits
every camera.

When compared to iPhone 13,

it enables photo low light improvement
up to two times on the front camera,

two times on the Ultra Wide camera,

and two-and-a-half times
on the new Main camera.

You'll get photos
with much better detail and color,

helping you remember
the moment the way you lived it.

There's also a big improvement
to video this year.

iPhone leads the industry
with the highest quality video

and has great stabilization.

It now has a new,
even more advanced stabilization mode

that gives users a powerful tool
when capturing moments on the move.

This is Action mode.

It uses the full sensor with more overscan
and advanced roll correction

to make video look incredibly stable
when you're in middle of the action.

Simply toggle it on
for great-looking, smooth video,

without having to carry extra gear
like a gimbal.

It also supports and Dolby Vision HDR.

The new iPhone 14 camera system
is a huge upgrade,

enabling incredible-looking shots across
the entire range of shooting conditions.

Back to you, Kaiann.

Now let's talk about connectivity.

iPhone has powerful capabilities

that help our users stay in touch
on the go.

This is especially true for 5G,
enabling super fast downloads,

better streaming,
and real-time connectivity.

And momentum for 5G is stronger than ever,

with over 250 carriers around the world
on 5G.

We've also made big improvements
to cellular technologies like eSIM,

making it even easier to connect.

An eSIM is a digital SIM that eliminates
the need for a physical SIM card.

With eSIM, you can quickly transfer
an existing cellular plan

or get a new cellular plan,
all digitally.

You can even store multiple eSIMs
on the same device,

meaning multiple cellular plans
and phone numbers.

And it's more secure.

Someone can't remove
the physical SIM card

if your iPhone is lost or stolen.

eSIM setup is easy.

In just a few simple steps,
users are ready to make calls,

send messages, and browse the web.

You can even do this
without a Wi-Fi connection.

Extensive planning and testing
with carriers

helped enable the iPhone eSIM experience.

This includes the US,
where eSIM support has skyrocketed,

thanks to AT&T,
T-Mobile, Verizon, and many more.

Now, for the first time, all US models
no longer have the SIM tray,

so you don't have to deal
with a physical SIM card anymore.

eSIM provides a simpler way
to activate and use iPhone.

Next, let's talk about some features

that make iPhone even more essential.

iPhone is there when you need it most.

That confidence is especially important
in moments where your safety is at risk.

With iPhone 14,
we have two critical new safety features.

It has Crash Detection–

the same feature you just heard about
on new Apple Watch models.

iPhone 14 has a new,
high dynamic range gyroscope

and a new dual-core accelerometer

that is able to detect up to 256 g's,

and it can automatically notify
emergency services

and emergency contacts
if you are in a severe car crash.

If you have both Apple Watch
and iPhone,

they seamlessly work together
to get you help efficiently.

Now here's Ashley to tell you
about another new safety service

coming to iPhone.

Emergencies don't always
happen when it's convenient.

When you need help,
you need it wherever you are,

even if you don't have Wi-Fi
or cell service.

Now, your iPhone can connect you
with the help you need

when you're off the grid, like this.

Rescue 07, Command.

Please be advised,
a storm is headed your way

two miles southeast.

Today, we are announcing
a groundbreaking new service for iPhone:

Emergency SOS via satellite.

While iPhone is designed
for a best-in-class cellular experience,

connecting to a satellite presents
an entirely new set of challenges.

Smartphones connect to cell towers
that are a few miles away.

Over the last several decades,

carriers have built
more and more cell towers

to improve the strength and speed
of their network service.

However, there are some places–
like winding back roads

and mountain ridges–
that cell towers don't reach.

Connectivity in these areas can
be provided by communication satellites.

Unlike stationary cell towers,

communication satellites
are hundreds of miles above the Earth,

and flying at over 15,000 miles per hour.

To connect to these satellites,
you need to be outside,

with a clear view of the sky.

And the bandwidth is so limited
that even sending a text message

is a technical challenge.

Typically, the only way to tap
into such a network

is with an expensive device
that uses a bulky external antenna.

We knew that approach
just wouldn't work for iPhone.

So we invented another way.

We designed and built custom components
and specific software

so that iPhone 14 antennas can connect
to satellites' unique frequencies.

That connection is only possible
when the phone is pointing

directly at a satellite.

However, satellites fly too high
to be seen by the human eye.

So we created a unique user experience
that shows you where to point your phone

to establish a connection,
and stay connected as the satellite moves.

This way, no bulky antenna is needed.

Once connected,
you need to send and receive

enough information to get emergency help.

Standard messaging protocols
are not designed

for a satellite's limited bandwidth.

So we created a custom
short text compression algorithm

to reduce the average size of messages
by a factor of three.

Thanks to this algorithm,
it can take less than 15 seconds

to send a message
if you have a clear view of the sky.

In other conditions,
such as light foliage,

it may take a few minutes.

And since each message can take some time,

we knew a standard back-and-forth
conversation

would take far too long
for an emergency situation.

We worked with emergency experts
to surface the questions

they're most likely to ask,

and we provided the most common responses

for you to choose from
with just a few taps.

With fewer messages to write and send,

you can get help quicker.

After your message
is relayed to a ground station,

it needs to reach
the right emergency service provider.

If that emergency service provider
accepts text messages,

we will connect you to them directly.

If they only accept voice calls,
we have set up Relay Centers,

staffed with highly-trained
emergency specialists

ready to get your text and call an
emergency service provider on your behalf.

It took years
to make this vision a reality

through game-changing hardware, software,
and infrastructure innovation.

This breakthrough service can also be used

in more casual, less dire circumstances.

So if you're out on a long hike,
you can use the Find My app

to share your location manually
via satellite.

This lets your loved ones know
where you are,

without you even sending a message.

Now, back to Kaiann.

Kaiann: We believe that this service

is such an essential part
of the iPhone experience

that we'll include it free for two years
with iPhone 14.

It launches in November,
and we're starting with the US and Canada.

Now, let's talk about the environment.

Since 2020, Apple's corporate operations
have been carbon neutral.

To reach our goal
of carbon neutral products by 2030,

we're looking at our environmental impact
across our supply chain

and the entire product lifecycle.

Over 200 of our suppliers have committed

to 100% renewable energy
for Apple production.

Our suppliers work to create less waste
and then reuse, recycle, or compost.

In fiscal year 2021 alone,

iPhone suppliers kept
over 250,000 metric tons of waste

from ending up in a landfill–

that's about one year's worth of waste

from 730,000 households.

We build our products to last.

This durability enabled millions of
trade-ins to find new owners in 2021.

And when it is time to recycle an iPhone,

that has environmental benefits too.

In fact, one metric ton of recovered
main logic boards and cameras

has the same amount of gold and copper
as over 2,000 metric tons of mined rock.

So don't throw away your old iPhone
or leave it sitting in a drawer–

bring it to your nearest store
or mail it in.

Together, we can reduce our impact
on the planet one step at a time.

And that's iPhone 14,

with powerful new cameras,
Photonic Engine,

Action mode,
A15 Bionic with a 5-core GPU,

Emergency SOS via satellite,
Crash Detection,

and the larger 6.7" display size
with the best battery life in an iPhone,

and so much more.

And later this fall, Apple Fitness+
will be available to all iPhone users,

even if they don't yet have
an Apple Watch.

iPhone 14 will start at just $799.

This is the same starting price
as last year's iPhone 13,

but with so much more capability
that sets a new standard for iPhone.

And iPhone 14 Plus starts at just $899,

bringing the larger 6.7" display

and the best battery life
to more people than ever.

We also have incredible offers
from Apple and our partners,

including up to $800 off in the US

when you trade in a qualifying iPhone.

iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus
are available for pre-order

starting on September 9th.

iPhone 14 will be available
on September 16th,

and iPhone 14 Plus will be available
on October 7th.

We're thrilled about iPhone 14.
Let's take a look.


There's simply nothing like iPhone 14.

Now, back to Tim.
