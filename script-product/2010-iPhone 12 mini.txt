This is iPhone 12 mini.

With its amazing size,
it fits in the palm of your hand,

while still keeping the expansive
edge-to-edge Super Retina XDR display.

It's smaller and lighter than
our 4.7-inch models like iPhone 8,

but with a larger 5.4-inch display
that lets you see so much more.

With its compact size,

the iPhone 12 mini has
the exact same features as iPhone 12.

You're just choosing
between two great sizes.

In fact, iPhone 12 mini
is the smallest, thinnest

and lightest 5G phone in the world.

With its large screen and compact size,

we think this will be
an incredibly popular iPhone.

Everything on iPhone 12
and iPhone 12 mini is the latest:

5G, the fastest chip with A14 Bionic,

most advanced display with OLED,

all-new design with Ceramic Shield,

even better water resistance,
new cameras for low light,

and MagSafe.
