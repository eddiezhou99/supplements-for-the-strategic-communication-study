Now, today, we're going to take

iPhone X to the next level.

I'm excited to show you what is

by far the most advanced iPhone

we have ever created.

This is iPhone XS.

It is the most advance iPhone

we've ever created, and I'd like

to invite Phillip to tell you

all about it.

Phil.

Good morning everyone.

I am so excited to tell you all

about iPhone XS.

It is made of a surgical-grade

stainless steel.

It has a gorgeous new gold

finish on the front and on the

glass.

It is the most beautiful iPhone

we have ever made.

The screen goes top to bottom,

edge to edge, rounded into the

corners.

And it's covered on the front

and the back with a new

formulation of glass that is the

most durable glass ever in a

smartphone.

iPhone XS comes in three

finishes, gold, silver, and

space gray.

They are beautiful, and they're

protected from dust and liquids

to an even higher level now.

IP68, that means it's protected

to two meters for up to 30

minutes.

So if you happen to be hanging

by the pool, drop your phone in

the water, don't worry.

Dive down, grab it, rinse it,

let it dry, you'll be fine.

And the team tested it in my

different liquids, in

chlorinated water, salt water,

orange juice, tea, wine, even

beer.

This is some of the most fun,

intense testing we get to do at

Apple.

The screen on iPhone XS is a

Super Retina display, the best

we've made yet.

It's an OLED display, 5.8 inches

on the diagonal, and it's 2.7

million pixels, 458 pixels per

inch, the highest quality

display on an iOS device.

Now let's put it side by side

with our plus size phone, an

iPhone 8 Plus, and as you can

see, it's as big a display as

the plus size phone but in a

smaller design, and so many

customers love that about that,

big display, easy, comfortable

to hold in your hand.

And it looks incredible.

Watching movies on it, the

latest HDR movies like Lego

Batman, using the latest

formats, Dolby Vision, HDR10.

Your photos look stunning on

iPhone XS.

You shoot them with beautiful,

wide color, and they display

better than ever on the new

Super Retina display because it

has a 60 percent greater dynamic

range for colors in your photos

than the iPhone X's display.

It is gorgeous.

Well the iPhone XS is not just

one but two sizes of display,

the 5.8 inch and a new 6.5 inch

Super Retina display.

This is the biggest display ever

on an iPhone.

It is an OLED display as well,

3.3 million pixels, 458 pixels

per inch again.

Now a lot of our customers have

loved the plus size iPhone.

So let's put that side by side.

You can see, it's about the same

size phone with a much larger

display.

We think there are a lot of

customers who are going to love

this larger display.

Now, the 5.8 inch, we already

said was as big as a plus size

display, so what do you call a

phone that's bigger than plus

size?

Well, we call it the iPhone XS

Max.

And the Max is an incredible

experience.

Watching videos on it is

cinematic.

Looking at your photos bigger

than ever is incredible.

Surfing the web, looking at fly

overs in Map, even when you're

using some of the built-in apps,

the team's taken advantage of

the wider display when it's in

horizontal mode to give you a

split view like here in

contacts.

It's awesome for editing videos

in iMovie for creating songs

with Garage Band and even

playing immersive killer games

is so much fun on the iPhone XS

Max.

So, there are two Super Retina

displays now, 5.8 inch, 6.5

inch, both OLED displays, both a

million to one contrast ratio,

they're HDR displays.

They have fast 120 Hertz

touch-sensitive layer, that's

how it gets its smooth scrolling

really fast typing and gaming

response.

They both have 3D touch for

pressure sensitivity.

They have tap to wake.

They have incredible color

management.

They're true tone display, so

the paper white looks just right

in all the different lighting

that you use it, and they have

wide color.

These are amazing displays.

And we've matched them to

incredible sound systems as

well.

Stereo sound, better than in any

iPhone today.

Now, with the 10S, you get a

wider stereo field.

The team has matched powerful

speakers with great software to

deliver an even richer sound

experience.

So watching movies sounds

incredible.

And playing games, like Alto

Odyssey, which previously you

put on headphones.

Now you just want to listen

through the speakers because of

that beautiful wide stereo

sound.

Of course, listening to music

and watching music videos like

the Foo Fighters sounds better

than ever.

All right.

Let's talk about Face ID.

Face ID is a huge step forward

in biometric protection for all

of our personal data on our

devices, and customers love it.

It is powered by our TrueDepth

camera system.

And there's so much technology

in that little space right

there.

An infrared camera, flood

illuminator, proximity sensor,

ambient light sensor, dot

projector, front camera, speaker

and microphone, all working

together to give protection to

the data on our devices.

And they're designed with

multiple neural networks, so

it's secure and seamless in the

iPhone experience.

With iPhone XS, you just pick up

your iPhone, look at it, it

recognizes your face and unlocks

your notifications and

information.

And it does it faster than ever

before because the XS now has

faster algorithms and runs on a

faster version of the secure

enclave, so it's gotten even

better.

Face ID works remarkably well.

In fact, we're proud to say it

is the most secure facial

authentication ever in a

smartphone.

Powering Face ID in everything

we do on the iPhone is our A

series chip, and the team has

worked so hard to make every

generation of the A series chip

better than any and ever in a

smartphone, and this year is no

exception.

What the team has done is truly,

truly, breakthrough.

It's called the A12 Bionic.

And the A12 Bionic is the

industry's first seven nanometer

chip, and that's a huge

breakthrough, yes.

The A12 Bionic is packed with

6.9 billion transistors, and

what the team has done with all

that is remarkable.

So let's go through some of the

things in this chip.

We're going to talk about the

CPU, the GUP, and the neural

engine.

Let's start with the CPU.

It's an Apple designed 6-core

CPU, this is a fusion system.

It has two high-performance

cores, four high-efficiency

cores.

The two high-performance cores

run up to 15 percent faster than

the cores in the A11 Bionic

while also being 40 percent more

energy efficient.

And the high efficiency cores

are up to 50 percent more energy

efficient, and all six cores can

run at once.

The GPU, well this is an Apple

designed GPU.

It is so powerful.

Now the A11 GPU was already

ahead of anything else in the

industry.

The A12 GPU is now up to 50

percent faster than the A11, so

a huge jump in graphics

performance.

But the real advancement, the

real blow-away thing is this

neural engine.

Now you know we introduced the

first neural engine last year

with the A11 Bionic.

With the A12 Bionic, we take it

much further.

The A11 was a 2-core design.

This is an 8-core dedicated

machine-learning engine to power

all that great machine learning

software on our systems, and it

has a smart compute system.

What that means, it's able to

analyze the neural network data

and figure out on the fly

whether to run it on the CPU,

the GPU, or the neural engine.

I mean this is breakthrough, and

the performance is unmatched.

We told you last year that A11

Bionic could process an insane

600 billion operations per

second.

Well the A12 Bionic is able to

process 5 trillion operations

per second.

Unbelievable.

Now the A12 Bionic is a complete

system on a chip, so there's so

much more.

And the team works very hard to

be just as innovative at every

one of these things in the A12

Bionic.

It has a next generation image

single processor, incredible

video coders and decoders.

There's our display engine, our

audio system.

Of course, it has a secure

enclave.

It has memory controllers,

storage controllers.

The Apple designed storage

controller and the A12 Bionic

can now address twice as much

internal storage as previously.

So now you can have up to 512

gigabytes of internal storage if

you want.

That's a half a terabyte on your

iPhone in your pocket.

That's enough for over 200,000

photos stored on your iPhone.

It is incredible.

This A12 Bionic is without

question the smartest and most

powerful chip ever in a

smartphone.

So much of the experience we

have with iPhone is driven by

this chip, and it's going to

enable us to have so many great

new experiences not possible

before.

So I'm very excited to bring out

Kaiann Drance to show you just

what we can do with iPhone and

Kaiann is our senior director of

iPhone product marketing.

Kaiann.

Thank you, Phil, thank you.

A12 Bionic was designed for

iPhone, not any other

smartphone.

This is one smartphone.

This is one of the reasons why

our team can deliver a chip

design for incredible

performance, great battery life

for everything iPhone needs,

from our everyday tasks to our

most advanced technologies, such

as every time you look at your

phone and unlock it with Face

ID, or playing an immersive game

on our edge-to-edge Super Retina

display and each time you take a

remarkable photo.

Every single thing you do

touches the chip, the CPU, the

GPU, or any other powerful

component all throughout, best

in class, and designed for

iPhone for the very best

performance.

So, next time you unlock your

phone, perhaps launch photos,

searching through the thousands

of photos you have to find just

the one you're looking for,

deciding how to share it amongst

different apps such as messages,

and then moving onto the next

thing, with multitasking,

perhaps landing in Maps to find

direction.

A12 Bionic makes these everyday

tasks feel fast and effortless.

And, A12 Bionic with the

performance updates in iOS 12

helps apps launch up to 30

percent faster.

So we're focused on these

everyday experiences, but even

beyond that, such as those that

make use of machine learning.

Now, we've used machine learning

for a number of years now to

make our features even better,

such as quick type suggestions

in messages, in memories, how we

curate your photos and videos,

getting real-time suggestions in

Maps when you need them, our

true-tone adaptive display, and

of course finding the very best

photo of your cat or other pet.

But what's really remarkable

this year is that our next

generation neural engine unlocks

the power of real-time machine

learning.

This is incredibly important for

apps like camera, and we use

that depth information for

portrait mode and portrait

lighting.

In Animoji, mapping those 50

different facial muscles over

your face in a live Facetime

call.

That is computationally really

intense.

And of course our immersive AR

experiences, our fun new Memoji,

and the new Clicks app launching

this fall will make use of

portrait segmentation on the

neural engine for even better

selfie scenes, like the one you

see here in Incredibles 2.

At iOS 12 we're also announcing

and launching Siri shortcuts, so

you can get even more done with

just a tap or by asking Siri to

help.

You can easily create a shortcut

with multiple steps, like the

one I used this morning.

Let's take a look.

I just press and hold or ask

Siri to run my keynote day

shortcut.

Now the first you'll do, it'll

kick off my HomeKit enabled

accessories, then it'll order my

morning coffee.

And it'll tell me how long it

takes for me to go pick it up.

And then it will kick off the

reminder I set to not forget my

badge, get me driving

directions, and start my music

playlist, and here we go.

And this is just one of many

things that you can do with Siri

shortcuts.

We're really excited this year

to be opening up our neural

engine to Core ML, and Core ML

is going to get a lot faster.

It's going to get up to nine

times faster.

But it's going to run with as

little as one-tenth the energy.

This is tremendous.

It means developers can run

their most complex, most

advanced neural networks in

their apps and do so even more

often.

Then freeing up the power of a

GPU for more immersive graphics

like never before, which by the

way is really useful for

augmented reality, and this is

another area that we're focused

on.

That camera view finder has

turned into a wonderful window

to these new AR experiences,

such as this app here called

Fishing Go, that lets you turn

your surroundings into this

immersive marine aquarium where

you can discover more than 200

species of sea life.

iPhone XS is the best platform

for AR.

We custom calibrate our cameras

and sensors for the best AR

experience.

In A12 Bionic, the GPU helps us

render realistic graphics, the

ISP for real-world lighting, and

the neural engine for object

reflections and more.

And it joins the best AR

software with ARKit 2, where

apps can access enhanced surface

and object detection, persistent

experiences, multiple users, and

we've even included a new

Measure app built-in.

And with AR Quick Look, you can

look at a 3D object like this

one here in Safari and with just

a tap bring it out into the real

world.

Isn't that amazing?

So you've heard some examples

today of how A12 Bionic is

accelerating real-world everyday

scenarios but also enabling new

experiences, but it doesn't end

with us.

It also extends out to our

talented pool of developers and

that wonderful ecosystem where

they have access to the best

software with iOS 12 and the A12

Bionic.

This takes us to the next

generation of apps, and we're

thrilled to have three

developers here today to show

you what's possible in just a

short amount of time.

Now, our first developer is

making use of the CPU and GPU to

take their game to the next

level of impact.

Please welcome Todd Howard, game

director of Bethesda Game

Studios.

Thanks Kianne.

Thank you.

You know, I wrote my first game

when I was 12 on an Apple 2, and

I got to tell you, I took full

advantage of every single one of

those low res 40 x 40 pixels.

And it's amazing how far we've

come.

With the technology that is

packed into our phones, we can

now start reaching for games

that are more than simple

diversions but experiences that

can truly transport you.

And with the new iPhone, we've

been able to do just that.

Let's take a look at our new

Elder Scrolls game, Blades.

Like series is known for, it is

a massive, first-person

role-playing game full of

stories, quests, and an

incredible world to explore.

You play one of the blades, the

empire's elite warriors, and

you'll define your own character

and how you want to engage in

combat.

You can use defense, melee, or

magic.

And on the iPhone's OLED screen,

we can pull out all of the

detail that you'd usually miss

in the bright and the dark

areas.

You can see the lighting from

these crystals bloom, reflect

off of the water.

We can have that lighting bounce

off of the walls.

And we can even have it reflect

off of your sword.

Additionally, we can use the new

stereo widening on the iPhone so

you can hear the forest around

you, all without headphones.

And scenes like this used to

only be possible in your living

room on a high-end gaming

console.

We can do them now on your phone

while doing full-screen

post-processing, all while

rendering 40 percent faster than

before.

You'll see the sword follows

Craig's specific movements and

timings.

It feels incredible, and that

new depth of field camera effect

really lets you focus your

actions during combat.

And spiders are just terrifying.

We've been able to pull off some

incredible environments that

just weren't possible before.

Twelve-year-old me would not be

able to comprehend all of these

pixels, all 2.7 million of them.

As we can use the

power of the phone to bring all

those parts together, the

visuals, the sound, and even

haptic feedback on your attacks.

It's not just immersive.

It transports you.

You may have fought dragons in

Skyrim, but you've never

experienced the Elder Scrolls

like this and on your phone.

Blades is coming to iOS this

Fall.

It's available for preorder

right now.

We'll see you out there.

Thank you, Todd.

Now our next developer is going

to enable an entirely new use

case for the iPhone camera using

Core ML.

Here's David Lee, CEO of

NexTeam, and Steve Nash,

two-time NBA MVP and a new

member of the Basketball Hall of

Fame.

Thanks Kianne.

HomeCourt is an app that used

Core ML to track basketball

shots by simply pointing your

iPhone at a court.

When I was young and learning

the game, I never really knew if

I was doing the right things to

improve my game.

I would spend hours and hours

shooting by myself, just hoping

I was refining the techniques

that would take me to the next

level.

I've been working closely with

the HomeCourt team on a tool

that will revolutionize

basketball training, and I can't

wait to show you what we can do

with the new iPhone.

We couldn't bring a

basketball court here, so we

went out last week and saw Steve

training an athlete.

We now have a screen recording

of our app on a new iPhone.

Let's take a look.

The app recognizes the hoop and

the court automatically.

Tap start, it will start

tracking real-time shot

attempts, the makes indicated by

the dot on the floor and misses

by the red X's drawn as an

overlay right on the court.

With the new iPhone and Core ML

2 we see a massive performance

game that allows us to do a lot

more.

The powerful A12 Bionic

models run up to

nine times faster, and that

unlocks new features that were

not possible before.

Let's take a look at what's

going on under the hood.

Only on a new iPhone we can run

real-time player tracking,

real-time post estimation,

real-time ball detection, and

trajectory estimation all at the

same time.

We call this real-time shot

science, that tracks six metrics

for every single shot the player

takes.

These insights are not visible

to the naked eye.

To become a great shooter,

you need to practice every day.

You need to shoot at game speed

and with the right posture.

I focus my students on staying

low and stable when they shoot.

HomeCourt is giving players

immediate feedback to help them

understand if they are

practicing with the right form.

Release time is also a great

indicator of whether the player

is shooting at game speed while

staying low.

These meaningful insights and

feedback just weren't possible

before.

Where you see that release

time from the set, it will be

displayed on screen, and app can

also give audio feedback for the

stereo speaker or

your earbuds.

As players train with

real-time feedback, they build

muscle memory.

I really wish that when I was

younger we had these tools.

HomeCourt is great for every

basketball player who wants to

get better, whether you're a

beginner or a pro.

The most amazing part is this

is all done with just your new

iPhone.

There are no sensors on the

player, no sensor on the ball,

and no sensor on the court, and

that's HomeCourt real-time shot

science, shipping as an update

this Fall.

Thank you.

Thank you Dave and Steve.

Wow, that was something.

Okay. So our third app makes use

of AR to do even more in a game.

Here is Atli Mar, CEO of

Directive Games.

Thanks Kianne.

Playing with friends at the

arcades has always been a lot of

fun.

Generations of gamers have

enjoyed countless hours playing

some of the world's best titles.

And now in AR, we are able to

have our own arcade cabinet

wherever and whenever we want.

And with ARKit 2, multiple

players are able to share the

same AR experiences.

Joining me here are my friends,

and they are eager to climb the

leader boards.

Andrea, Shai-Hi, Alessandra.

Are you guys ready?

We're ready to battle, Atli.

This is Galaga AR.

Just like the classic, you

eliminate your enemies, you

avoid being attacked, and you

grab power ups.

With the digital GPU Core, we

are able to render scenes like

the sun effect.

This is something that we could

not do before.

And the new iPhone stereo

widening makes things sound

really immersive.

Just listen to this epic

battle.

Last year, we shipped our first

AR game, and now, with new

features of ARKit 2 and the

power of the new iPhone, we are

able to craft experiences at a

much higher fidelity as well as

connect players both digitally

and in the physical world.

Look for the first game in our

AR arcade series on the App

Store later this year.

Thank you.

Wow. Wow.

We can't wait for you guys to

experience those apps and games.

This is really just the

beginning.

We're scratching the surface of

what's going to be possible on

the iPhone XS and the A12

Bionic.

No other chip in the world would

allow us to do this.

Thank you and now back to Phil.

Thank you, Kianne.

The A12 Bionic just powers so

many incredible new experiences,

and that includes the camera.

We all love the cameras in our

iPhone.

No doubt, you all know it is the

world's most popular camera and

for great reason.

Over ten years customers have

been taking incredible

photographs with their iPhone

cameras like this and sharing

them with us around the world

and telling us stories with

them.

And we're so proud of all the

people who use the iPhone camera

from consumers to even

increasingly professionals are

using them for photos like this.

This is a beautiful portrait

photo, but what makes us so

proud of it is that it appeared

on the cover of Time Magazine.

And this is their issue for

women who are changing the

world, and we couldn't be

prouder to be a part of that

story.

Well, you are going to be blown

away with the pictures you can

take with the iPhone XS's

camera.

It is a remarkable new

dual-camera system.

It has a 12-megapixel wide

camera, a 12-megapixel telephone

camera, and an even more

improved true-tone flash.

The 12-megapixel wide camera has

a new sensor, a larger sensor

with bigger, deeper pixels.

It has optical image

stabilization and our fast 1.8

aperture lens.

It's Apple's six-element lens.

The telephoto camera is also a

12-megapixel camera, also

optical image stabilization,

F2.4, Apple design lens.

On the front side, we have the

true-depth camera system, and

that's a new sensor as well.

A 7-megapixel sensor that's

twice as fast, and it works

together with the IR camera and

the dot projector, so it can

create depth in your

portrait-mode photos.

And as we talk about cameras, of

course everyone talks about the

sensors and the lens and rightly

so.

They're an important part of the

camera system.

But increasingly what makes

incredible photos possible

aren't just the sensor and the

lens, but it's the chip and

software that runs on it.

And this is so true with iPhone

photography.

So, for example, in the A12

Bionic is the image signal

processor, working together with

the CPU.

And it does so many things every

time we take a picture.

It automatically sets exposure,

white balance, sets the focus,

does noise reduction and low

light photography.

It brings out highlights and

details, and it can fuse

multiple images together like

when you do an HDR photo or

create a beautiful panorama.

And the ISP and the A12 Bionic

does all of this better than

ever before, but what it does

that is entirely new is connect

together the ISP with that

neural engine to use them

together to make our photos

incredible.

So, for example, the CPU, and

the neural engine can work

together to do detection of

people's faces and bodies, to

understand the scene that you're

shooting, and can do facial

landmarking.

So it recognizes exactly where

the eyes are and does instant

red eye reduction that looks

perfect.

And it creates better

segmentation masks so even with

portrait mode the hair and the

glasses are better than ever

before.

This is an amazing amount of

power for our camera team.

In fact, when you take a photo,

it's capable of doing a trillion

operations on every photo you

take.

And what the team is doing with

that power is truly remarkable.

We have a brand-new feature we

call Smart HDR.

And we all know what HDR is,

right.

You can take a couple photos and

merge them together to bring out

highlight and shadows and keep

your subject looking great.

Well, Smart HDR takes this idea

so much further.

So let's say you're taking a

picture, and the camera

recognizes you're shooting a

subject and the subject is

moving, you go to press down on

the shutter and you get a

picture instantly.

It's called zero shutter lag.

What the A12 Bionic is actually

doing is shooting a four-frame

buffer so it can capture that

critical moment.

The A12 Bionic is doing even

more than that.

It's also capturing secondary

interframes at the same time,

and those interframes are shot

at a different exposure level to

bring out highlight details.

And it's doing more than that.

It's shooting a long exposure so

we can get better shadow detail

as well.

And when you're taking that

picture, it's analyzing all of

those, finding out how to match

up the best parts of each and

merge them into one perfect

photo.

That's Smart HDR.

It is a breakthrough, and it

makes taking photos easier than

ever and to get beautiful

results.

So let me show you a few photos

shot with iPhone XS, not

retouched in any way, no

exterior lighting used, anything

else.

It's just straight from the

camera.

So here's one.

I mean this is stunning.

You're subject beautifully lit

with natural light, beautiful

skin tones, great detail, and a

nice beautiful soft background.

But what's remarkable about this

photo is it was a windy day by

the water, and her hair was

blowing.

Yet you still get that

incredible detail in her hair on

this Smart HDR photo.

Here's another example.

As you can see, this is what

you're not supposed to do,

right, shooting a photo into the

sun, because that's going to

blow out the exposure.

But Smart HDR makes sure we got

a great sky, we got detail on

the shadows of the water, but

most of all, look at the water

drops coming off of his hair and

how crisp and detailed they are.

That's incredible.

All your photos come out so much

better now with iPhone XS no

matter what your subject matter,

people, pets.

Look at the skin detail and the

hair and the beautiful sky.

Like we said, it shoots wide

color photos as well.

Look at the color range on this

photo.

Shot straight off iPhone XS.

And it looks even better with

the higher dynamic range display

on the iPhone XS when you look

at it there.

We introduced portrait mode and

portrait lighting photos.

Those are better than ever

before, and here's an example.

It's incredible the level of

detail.

This is the stage light feature

and the portrait lighting.

It looks so beautiful.

Here's another portrait lighting

photo, excuse me, portrait mode

photo.

Beautiful soft background.

These are better than ever

before, and there's a huge

advancement here.

Remember the area on the

background of the photo, the

quality of that blur is what the

industry calls bokeh.

And the team wanted to make a

big advancement in what can be

done with bokeh, and they've

done some amazing work here.

They studied some of the

highest-end full-frame cameras

and expensive fast lenses to

characterize the quality of

professional bokeh and then

bring that capability to more

and more of us through the

portrait mode photos that we can

take with iPhone, and what

they've achieved is really

breakthrough.

So I'm going to show you a photo

now, and I'll just tell you

right up front, this was not

shot with a high-end expensive

camera.

This was shot with an iPhone XS,

and it is breakthrough.

It is absolutely beautiful.

The detail on her face, the

great skin tones, obviously

reflecting from the surface of

the car to light it up, but that

background, and the quality of

that bokeh is remarkable.

This is a breakthrough in

photography for a smartphone.

But further than that, the team

discovered something remarkable.

This is so, so exciting.

I can't tell if you can tell I'm

excited about this, but this

is-- so when you take the

picture with portrait mode, and

then you go in to the photos

app, and you tap edit, you're

going to see a new slider on the

bottom that says depth.

Yeah, someone said no.

Get ready for this, because let

me blow it up, you're going to

have to watch two things at

once.

You're going to watch the depth,

and you're going to watch the

background.

You can, after taking the

picture, adjust the depth of

field, so that's 1.4, that's 16.

And the background is changing

with it.

Let's do that again.

We're going to slide a depth of

field, and watch the background

as it changes the depth of field

of your photo.

This is done after you've taken

it.

This has not been possible in

photography with any kind of

camera.

This is something that iPhone

can now do with the power of the

A12 Bionic chip.

Let me show you one more

example.

Here's another photo shot with

iPhone XS, and we see a

beautiful background with

incredible higher quality bokeh,

and as we looked at it, we slide

and we selected f2.0 because we

thought it had just the right

depth of field we want in the

photo.

This is a new era of

photography.

Some people call it

computational photography.

With a power of not only the

sensor and the lens, but the A12

Bionic and incredible software

and the care the camera team has

put to creating high-quality

photography is making images

possible now that weren't

before.

And the benefits of this, not

only for photography, but for

video as well, it's a new era of

videography as well, but this

new sensor and the power of that

A12 Bionic chip.

And it can do many things.

It has a twice as fast sensor.

It can take advantage of a lot

of this technology to give

better image quality in our

videos.

And there's something else the

team has done too.

Taking advantage of the four

microphones built into iPhone

XS, you can record stereo sound

with your videos as well.

And it plays back with that

beautiful wide stereo field, and

it sounds amazing.

So let me show you a quick video

that was shot with iPhone XS,

just natively shot on it,

nothing done to it other than we

edit it for length, and it's

shot in low light, and it

creates images that weren't

possible before.

Here we are.

Hey, what's up.

You made it up here.

Yeah. Had a little drive in.

And that's a beautiful video.

You just shoot it, 4K, but

there's a lot going on that the

system is doing for us.

Autofocus, auto exposure,

bringing up the highlight

details, the shadow details with

wider dynamic range, amazing

color rendering and tone mapping

and stereo sound being recorded

automatically.

So that's photography.

That's video.

That's our camera.

Now I'll talk about battery

life.

Increasingly, all smart phone

users want more performance,

bigger screens, but longer

battery life too.

The teams really worked hard on

this.

iPhone XS is able to compared to

iPhone X get you up to 30

minutes longer in your day than

iPhone X did, and that's really

great.

iPhone XS Max has the biggest

battery we've ever put into an

iPhone, and it can get you up to

an hour and a half longer in

your day.

And there's a lot more new with

iPhone XS and XS Max.

Faster networking, gigabit-class

LTE.

They have more bands than any

other smartphone, so they have

the best worldwide roaming and

speaking of worldwide

capabilities, one thing we've

had requests for is dual SIM

capability.

Well some of you know what this

is for.

For the rest, here are some

reasons people want dual SIM.

Some people want two phone

numbers on their phone.

Maybe a home number and a work

number.

Some want two different plans

depending on the region of the

world they're in and what they

need.

And many of us like to travel

and want to keep our local phone

number but may need to get a

data plan in a region we're in

so we can have access to fast

data there.

To do this, into iPhone XS and

XS Max, we built a technology

called DSDS, or Dual SIM Dual

Standby.

This means that you have both

phone numbers there in your

phone waiting to get call,

whichever one gets it becomes

the active line.

And to enable that, the we've

added our eSIM technology.

eSIM is a standard that we've

been working with carriers to

promote around the world.

We've actually already been

shipping it in cellular iPads,

in cellular watches, and now

we're bringing it to iPhone.

So with eSIM it's built in, easy

to set up a second line.

You can point your camera at a

QR code from a carrier and set

it up, and the team has worked

to make sure in the software

that the fact that you have two

different phone numbers is

understood.

And you can name them home and

work, primary and secondary,

whatever.

And then throughout the user

experience, you'll see that a

phone call is coming in on a

certain line, and you know how

to deal with that.

Support for eSIM requires

support from carriers, and we've

been working with many great

carrier partners, and they're

going to be rolling out eSIM

support throughout the fall and

many more into next year.

We're really, really happy to be

working with them on this.

So that's how we provide dual

SIM support around the world.

We will have a single physical

SIM and a eSIM in both iPhone XS

and XS Max.

In China, where we can't bring

eSIM into iPhone yet, we're

making a special model of the

iPhone XS Max that has two

physical SIMs, actually one on

each side of the SIM tray.

It's a really smart

implementation, and we think

they're going to love that.

So this is iPhone XS and XS Max.

They are packed with so many new

advancements.

Better Super Retina displays,

5.8 inch and the new 6.5 inch

OLED displays.

Our next generation 7 nanometer

A12 Bionic chip with faster CPU,

GPU, neural engine, and helping

us to deliver even longer

battery life.

Our new generation dual camera

system with a bigger sensor,

Smart HDR, portrait mode with

more beautiful bokeh, dynamic

depth of field, higher quality

videos with HD and 4K, new

true-depth camera system that's

faster for Face ID,

gigabit-class LTE, beautiful new

gold finish, protection to IP68

and so much more.

These are incredible new

iPhones.

And the team works really hard

to make these iPhones in the

most environmentally friendly

manner possible.

And to tell you a little bit

more about that, I'm really

excited to bring out Lisa.

Thanks Phil.

You know, we never stop thinking

about what's best for the

planet.

This starts with our products,

but it extends to everything we

do at Apple.

So, for instance, earlier this

year we announced something

pretty amazing.

You may have heard about it

already, but we can't help

repeating ourselves because we

now run Apple on 100 percent

renewable energy at all of our

facilities worldwide.

Now of course that includes the

gorgeous campus that we're on

right now.

It's powered by our own solar

panels and directed biogas fuel

cells.

But it's also about the

facilities that you don't often

see, like our data centers,

which use lots of clean energy

to support services, like

iMessage.

And that means every time you

send an iMessage or make a

Facetime video call, we're using

lots of clean energy to make

that happen.

Now when we set out to do this,

people said it couldn't be done.

And if you know Apple, those are

exactly the kinds of challenges

that we love.

So we've done it, and we're

really really proud of it.

And now, we're on to the next

challenge.

We hope to one day eliminate our

need to mine new materials from

the Earth.

Now as you can imagine, this is

a massive effort.

So to reach that goal, we have

to do three things.

First, we'll have to find new

ways to make our products with

recycled or renewable materials

that are sourced responsibly.

Then we'll have to ensure that

our products last as long as

possible.

And then finally after a long

life of use, we have to ensure

that they're recycled properly.

So let's take a look at some of

the material innovations within

the new iPhones that we've just

announced.

We've transitioned to using

recycled tin in the main logic

board of iPhone including the

new iPhone XS, and of course

this is with no reduction in

quality or performance.

This one change will prevent the

mining of over 10,000 tons of

tin ore in a single year.

And we're doing this with other

materials as well.

We have a better plastics

program, and through that we're

reducing our use of traditional

plastics and transitioning to

recycled and bio-based

materials.

For example, the speaker

enclosure for iPhone XS is now

made with 35 percent

post-consumer recycled plastic.

And the cover glass frame is

made with 32 percent bio-based

plastic.

It's better for the planet, but

it's also tougher and it

performs better.

Second, we also make sure to

design and build durable

products that last as long as

possible.

That means long-lasting hardware

coupled with our amazing

software.

All of these devices, including

the iPhone 5S run iOS 12 and iOS

12 is designed to make your

iPhone and iPad experience even

better, even more responsive,

faster, just better, and because

they last longer, you can keep

using them, and keeping using

them is the best thing for the

planet.


And finally, when it comes time

to reuse and recycle, we have

Apple GiveBack.

This is something I'm really

proud of.

With Apple GiveBack, it doesn't

matter what device you have or

what condition it's in, bring it

in or mail it into us.

We'll assess it, and if it can

be used by someone else, we'll

give you the value.

If not, we'll recycle it

properly for free.

Maybe we'll even use the robot.

Who remembers Liam?

Well meet his sister, Daisy, who

can disassemble nine different

models of iPhone.

Using Daisy, we can reuse those

recycled materials in future

products, and the more we do

this, the less we'll have to

mine from the Earth.

So that iPhone 5S, with Apple

GiveBack, it can go on to

another user when you're ready

to switch to a new iPhone.

And when it comes to the new

iPhone XS, you can feel

confident that it too was

designed for another long life

of use.

Either way, it's good for you,

but it is a huge win for the

planet.

Thank you.

Thank you, Lisa.

This work is really important to

all the teams at Apple, and it's

a great example of the

collaboration between all the

teams to do everything from

reducing the amount of tin in

products to the GiveBack

program.

Just great work and we're really

proud of everything they do.

So, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max,

they are stunning, the best

iPhones we've ever made by a

long shot.

We are so excited about the

technologies in here, the

experiences they're going to

bring to people, and we hope

customers love them just as much

as we do.
